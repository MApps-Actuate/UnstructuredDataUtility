<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>The accused was charged with two counts of trafficking in cocaine -- The sole issue was whether the Crown had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was the person who sold cocaine to the undercover police officer as alleged -- The accused challenged the reliability and sufficiency of the identification evidence -- HELD: The accused was acquitted -- Despite the officer's testimony that she was 100 per cent sure the accused was the person in question, her confirmation that she reviewed the accused's arrest photograph immediately prior to trial testimony "just to be sure" betrayed this level of certainty -- Even considered in the best possible light, it nevertheless casted reasonable doubt with respect to its reliability and correctness -- The entirety of the evidence at trial reinforced the doubt created by this most crucial area of the officer's testimony -- The encounters with the drug dealer were of fairly short duration and in fairly stressful circumstances, where one of the main objectives was to get the transactions done quickly in the interests of her safety as an undercover officer -- In the first two meetings, the seller's head was not fully visible as it was partially covered by a hood -- The descriptions she provided were fairly generic and hardly remarkable -- The fact that he had been driving the vehicle involved in the transactions nearly a month later on the day of his arrest was not sufficiently contemporaneous to prove he was the operator of the vehicle at the time of the transaction. </summary>
