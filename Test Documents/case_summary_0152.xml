<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>In this family law proceeding, the father sought custody of the parties' 11-year-old child, a determination as to access, forgiveness of child support arrears, and an elimination of his obligation to pay child support and special expenses -- He argued that the mother ought to be found in contempt of court for failing to respect court orders, including unilaterally terminating the services of the parties retained to carry out a parental assessment, and failing to respect certain access orders -- The mother wished to remain the child's primary caregiver, and argued access to the father ought only to proceed after being approved by a psychologist -- HELD: The parties would have shared custody of the boy, and there would be no child support order -- Presently, the father had no income as he was a full-time caregiver for his nine-month old daughter, and thus he would have no child support obligation at this time -- With respect to contempt finding, although the mother had unilaterally terminated the parties involved in the parental assessment, they were replaced by a party who did carry out the assessment -- However, she had failed to make any effort to ensure that at the very least the child was available for his father's visits, and she was in contempt for wilfully disobeyed a prior order of the court; however, the court exercised its discretion not to punish her -- Both parties were capable of parenting the child and caring for him -- The mother had used her role as custodian to control everything and to tell anyone involved that the father was an awful father, which was not true -- The mother had intentionally alienated the child from his father -- The parties would have shared custody of the child, each having custody for half the week -- There would be no child support order -- The father had already paid more child support than he should have given his income levels, and any arrears were rescinded -- The father was awarded $5,000 in costs. </summary>
