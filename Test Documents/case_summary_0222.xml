<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>This was an appeal in a mechanics' lien action. The action was being dismissed against M and the bond should have been released by the judgment. By agreeing to the wording of the judgment, counsel for M confirmed the mistaken belief that the plaintiff could look to the bond without a judgment against M and thus unwittingly deceived counsel for the plaintiff and the court. 	HELD: The portion of the judgment dismissing the action against M was set aside and the trial was to continue against M to assess its liability to the plaintiff as owner. </summary>
