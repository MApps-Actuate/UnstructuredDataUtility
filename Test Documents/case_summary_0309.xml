<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by the wife for divorce -- Parties were married in October 1998 -- They were parents of one child, born January 19, 2000 -- They began to live separate and apart on August 1, 2002, and had not reconciled -- Issues in the within proceeding were custody, access and child support -- Applicant sought: custody, child support plus s. 7(1) expenses as of the date of separation; an order prohibiting the respondent from removing the child from Ontario, without written consent of the applicant; an order that the respondent post a bond in the amount of $10,000 which would escheat to the Crown if the respondent unilaterally removed the child from Ontario; the surrender, by the husband, of any travel documents he held for the child; and an order that the respondent designate the applicant, in trust for the child, as beneficiary of his life insurance policy(ies) -- Respondent sought sole custody of the child, or alternatively, joint custody, with periods of unsupervised access -- By way of answer and counter-petition, the respondent requested an order that the applicant sign all necessary travel documents to facilitate travel to Ghana or that such consent be dispensed with -- HELD: Application allowed -- The child had not spent any significant time with his father since August 2002, when he was two and a half years of age -- The stability and permanence of the applicant's home was of benefit to the child -- It would not be in the child's best interests to remove him from that family unit and place him in the care of his father who, for a significant amount of time, had not been involved in the child's care and upbringing -- Issue of the child's bi-racial heritage, while important, was not determinative of the issue of custody -- Overall well-being and healthy development of the child would be better served by his remaining in the custody of his mother -- Joint custody was inappropriate on the basis that the parties were unable to co-operate or communicate effectively -- Numerous conditions were attached to the access order on the basis that there was some risk of illegal removal -- Father was ordered to pay monthly support of $313 based on an imputed annual income of $36,000 -- Amount imputed was likely modest in comparison to his potential earnings. </summary>
