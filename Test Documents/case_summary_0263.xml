<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Motion for default judgment by the Regional Municipality of Halton against the defendants. The Municipality's claim against the defendants was based on the tort of deceit. The defendant Kobra Fathi lived with her three adult daughters, who were also named as defendants, in subsidized housing owned by the Municipality and also received income support from the Ontario Works program. The market rate for their unit was $1,088 per month. Effective on possession of the unit on August 1, 2000, the family was charged $320 per month. From August 1, 2002 to August 31, 2002, the rent was further reduced to $282. Fathi applied for and received the Ontario Works benefits on August 9, 2000. The Municipality asserted that from August 1, 2000 to August 31, 2002, the father of the children, the defendant Rezaizadeh, lived in the subsidized housing unit and earned income during some or all of this time. Fathi declared to the relevant authorities several times that she was separated from Rezaizadeh and that he did not reside with the family. She made similar factual misrepresentations to Ontario Works. 	HELD: Motion allowed in part. The tort of deceit was established against Fathi. She misled both Ontario Works and the housing authority by making misleading and false statements. The plaintiff relied on the representations to its detriment and suffered damage as a result. The plaintiff could not establish a case for the tort of deceit against the three daughters. The false declarations made by the daughters were either not relied upon by the plaintiff, because they were made after the level of income and rent subsidy had been set, or constituted silence in the face of false representations by their mother when they failed to correct her statements, which did not amount to false or negligent misrepresentation. The claim against Rezaizadeh failed because one of the essential ingredients of the case, a false statement of fact made by him, was not asserted in the claim. He never attended meetings, made no written or oral representation and never filled out forms. Judgment was granted against Fathi in the amount of $45,414.50. </summary>
