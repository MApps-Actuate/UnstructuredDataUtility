<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application under Rule 36.01 to examine under oath before trial three witnesses, namely a pediatric neurosurgeon, a general surgeon, and an engineer, to ensure their evidence would be available to be tendered at trial. The applicant further sought that such examinations would be videotaped. In the underlying action, the minor respondent claimed damages for injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident. The limitation period would not begin to run until his 18th birthday in 2019. The applicant argued with the advanced age of the witnesses they might not be available to testify. The issues included whether res judicata applied to the application. The Court of Appeal had refused such an application under a previous version of the rule. A subsequent amendment permitted the court to exercise its discretion to order the examination of witnesses before an action was commenced. 	HELD: Application dismissed. The application was barred by res judicata. The issue was finally adjudicated by the Court of Appeal, with leave to appeal having been denied by the Supreme Court of Canada. This case presented no special circumstances that called for the matter to be re-adjudicated. Any prejudice to the applicant was outweighed by prejudice to the respondent. Any general surgeon or pediatric neurologist could examine the medical records if required in the future by the commencement of an action. A decision in favour of the Applicant could establish a precedent that could encourage well-resourced defendants to force injured minors to incur extraordinary expenses to prove parts of their cases in circumstances where actions have not even been commenced. </summary>
