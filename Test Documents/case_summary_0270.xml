<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Sentencing of the defendant JF following his jury conviction of manslaughter. JF and his wife had been found responsible for the death of their four-year-old foster child. In separate proceedings, the wife had admitted inflicting blunt trauma to the child's head, thereby causing his death. She had not yet been sentenced. A post-mortem examination found several traumatic injuries on the child. There was no evidence JF had actively inflicted injury on the child. The jury found JF was aware of the risk to the safety of the child from the wife's conduct but ignored that risk. JF had separated from his wife, moved into a new community, and was in a new relationship. His common-law wife was pregnant. JF worked intermittently. He had a limited criminal record. He apologized for the role he played in the child's death. 	HELD: JF was sentenced to imprisonment for two years less one day. Crimes resulting in the death of small children, the most vulnerable members of society, were especially serious and among the most abhorrent. JF had deliberately assumed parental responsibility for the child. He failed in his duty to the child and abused a position of trust. It was highly unlikely JF would re-offend in a similar manner. Denunciation and general deterrence were the foremost considerations. The need for denunciation was sufficiently pressing that incarceration was the only suitable way to express society's condemnation of JF's conduct. </summary>
