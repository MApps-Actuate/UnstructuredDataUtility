<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by the plaintiff to amend or alter the trial judgment because the judgment failed to adjudicate on a significant issue. The defendants had forwarded a signed order to the plaintiff in December 2008. In February 2009, they received notice that the order had not been entered and that the plaintiff had applied to re-open the trial judgment on the basis that a formal order had not been entered. The plaintiff and the defendants had both appealed the judgment, however the defendants had abandoned their appeal. The plaintiff asked the court to reconsider the issue of the plaintiff's loss and costs of school as costs of mitigating damages and claimed that although the issue was raised at trial, it was not adjudicated upon in the reasons for judgment. The plaintiff argued that prior to the accident he was on the path to becoming a manual labourer, but because of the accident, he would have to go to university. His position was that the costs of tutoring to get into university and the costs of university and post-graduate studies were reasonable for him to reach the earning capacity contemplated in the reasons for judgment and that those costs ought to be borne by the defendants as they were costs associated with a new course of action which lessened the ultimate loss or damage. The plaintiff also claimed that only approximately one-half of the award had been paid to him and as a result, that money could not be invested. He also argued that given interest rates had plunged, the net award should be increased to be fair to him to establish a proper investment. The defendants argued that it was the plaintiff's responsibility to enter the order and as a result he could not benefit from the fact that the order had not been entered earlier. 	HELD: Application dismissed. The plaintiff failed to show that the Court must re-open the case to avoid a miscarriage of justice. All of the issues raised at trial were dealt with in the reasons for judgment. The plaintiff failed to show that any delay of the defendants in paying had caused a loss to him. </summary>
