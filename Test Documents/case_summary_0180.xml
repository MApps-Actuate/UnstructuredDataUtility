<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Motion by the defendant Plourde for an order removing the plaintiffs' solicitors as solicitors of record. The defendant was an army Captain and a town councilor. The plaintiffs were his commanding officer and former commanding officer. In 2006, the defendant retained a solicitor from the law firm now representing the plaintiffs with respect to alleged harassment by the plaintiffs at work. The defendant then retained other counsel. The plaintiffs sued the defendant in defamation based on statements made by the defendant in a speech when he resigned as councilor due to the plaintiffs' alleged harassing conduct. The defendant alleged he had retained the solicitor from the firm now representing the plaintiffs in connection with the same defamation matter that was the subject of this action. The plaintiffs' lawyer alleged the firm was retained only with respect to an internal military matter. 	HELD: Motion allowed. The two retainers at issue were related. The plaintiffs' law firm was in a relationship with the defendant which was relevant to the matter at hand and involved essentially the same issues. The presumption that confidential information had been imparted had not been displaced nor had the presumption that the information would be disclosed and shared by members of the plaintiffs' law firm. A reasonably informed person would not be satisfied that no use of confidential information would occur. </summary>
