<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Action by plaintiff for damages for injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident in March 2004. The plaintiff was 39 years old at the time of the accident. He had stopped his minivan and was struck from behind by a car driven by the defendant Dutta, which had been struck from behind by the vehicle driven by the defendant Fust. The plaintiff's vehicle was pushed into the vehicle ahead of him. Liability was admitted by Fust and the action against the other two defendants was discontinued before trial. The defendant acknowledged that the plaintiff was injured in the accident and the only issues were general and special damages, past and future income loss/loss of opportunity and future care costs. The plaintiff was employed in the herbal medicine profession. Prior to the accident he taught two or three classes per week and supervised clinical hours for approximately 25 hours per week at a herbal college. In addition, he had a herbal practice in which he practiced two days per week as a clinician. At the time of the accident, the plaintiff was planning on opening a second clinic and retail store. Prior to the accident the plaintiff was in very good health, was involved in recreational activities with his children and friends and worked out at the gym on occasion. Immediately after the accident, the plaintiff felt pain throughout his body, mostly in hose arm, leg, back, shoulders and neck. He was taken to hospital by ambulance where he was told he was in shock and that his symptoms of headache, nausea and tingling in his limbs were typical. For the first few weeks after the accident, the plaintiff complained of body aches particularly in his neck and shoulders. He did not sleep well, was unable to sit comfortably, was emotionally unwell and unable to go to work. He was diagnosed by his family doctor with paracervical, parathoracic and paralumbar muscle strain, left shoulder strain and muscle tension headaches for which he received ice, heat, rest, exercises, massage therapy, kinesiology, acupuncture, herbal medicines and medications. For the first few months after the accident, the plaintiff's symptoms worsened, but he began to notice some improvement three to six months after the accident and returned to work approximately three months after the accident. Nine months after the accident, some of his symptoms improved, but others were still present and he took further chiropractic, acupuncture and massage treatments and saw his doctor regularly. Through 2005, the plaintiff was unable to work as much as he anticipated and he closed one of his clinics. Through 2006, his complaints improved, with some flare-ups and he continued to receive chiropractic treatments and take herbal medications. By 2007, the plaintiff felt his symptoms had started to plateau. He continued to do what his therapist recommended and was working sporadically. The medical report of his doctor indicated that the plaintiff's injuries included cervical and thoracic disc herniations, but was unsure as to whether the herniations were caused by the accident or made symptomatic by the accident. The doctor concluded that the prognosis for a full recovery was poor and that the plaintiff's condition had plateaued. 	HELD: Action allowed. The plaintiff suffered paracervical parathoracic and paralumbar muscle strain, left shoulder strain and muscle tension headaches from the accident and his condition had plateaued. In addition, the accident likely caused the disc herniations in the plaintiff's back to become symptomatic and the plaintiff would continue to require chiropractic treatment and would benefit from a personal trainer. The plaintiff experienced a loss of income as a result of the accident and was unable to pursue business opportunities as vigorously as he would were it not for the accident. Plaintiff awarded $60,000 for non-pecuniary damages, $37,935 for past income loss/loss of opportunity, $50,000 for future income loss/loss of opportunity, $7,181 for special damages, and $13,943 for costs of future care. </summary>
