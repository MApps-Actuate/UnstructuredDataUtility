<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application for an order that amendments to s. 258(1)(c) of the Criminal Code by virtue of s. 24(4) of Bill C-2 were not and ought not to be applied retrospectively as being unconstitutional and inconsistent with the Charter, and that they were of no force and effect. The applicant further sought a stay of the charges against him by reason of the Crown's failure to provide disclosure as requested, or alternatively, he sought an adjournment. The issues included whether the July 2nd, 2008 amendments applied retrospectively to pre-July 2, 2008 charges. The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving while over the legal limit, both allegedly committed on March 29, 2007. The trial began on May 29, 2008. 	HELD: The amendments were declared to apply retrospectively to the applicant. The "evidence to the contrary" defence remained in place, even though now there were additional evidentiary elements required to raise the defence. The amendments in no way changed the elements of the offence of driving while over the legal limit. The amendments applied retrospectively to trials of charges where the allegation date was prior to July 2, 2008. There was no meaningful distinction between scenarios where the amendments had been applied in midstream or mid-trial, or where the charge date was prior to July 2, 2008 but the actual trial commenced afterwards. Remedial steps had been taken in this case. The amendments to s. 258(1) were evidentiary or procedural in nature, they were not substantive, and there was no legal difference where the amendments came into play and force during the trial, and they were applicable retrospectively to charges arising before July 2, 2008 irrespective of whether or not the trial commenced before or after that date. The issues of the constitutional validity/ invalidity of the amendments were to be addressed at a later point in the case. </summary>
