<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Appeal by the accused from conviction for possession of cocaine and marijuana for the purpose of trafficking. The appellant argued the trial judge erred in refusing to exclude the drugs seized from his residence due to a breach of his rights of ss. 8 and 9 of the Charter. The appellant reported a home invasion. One of the invaders informed police that the appellant had provided her with drugs and that he kept cocaine and weapons in his residence. The appellant was then brought to the station from the hospital to be interviewed in regards to the home invasion. The appellant was then advised that he was also being investigated for possession of a controlled substance and he was arrested for possession of a controlled substance and was detained until a search of his residence was conducted. The officer examining the home invasion crime scene discovered marijuana in a locked room. The police obtained a telewarrant and searched the residence. 	HELD: Appeal dismissed. Any common-law authority the police might have had to search the appellant's residence as a crime scene would not have given him carte blanche to search the entire premises and to enter the locked room. The trial judge made a palpable and overriding error when she found that one of the officer's purposes in entering the locked room was to investigate a home invasion. When he opened the door to the locked room he was not looking for, nor did he expect to find, anything that would further the home invasion investigation. Rather, his curiosity having been piqued by the electrical ballasts, his only purpose was to see if the room contained evidence of a drug offence. In doing so, the officer infringed the appellant's s. 8 Charter right. The appellant was not detained from the moment he left the hospital and was brought to the police station. There was no evidence that he was detained before being advised that he was the subject of a drug investigation. It was reasonable and in the public interest for the police to arrest him and hold him in custody while the police continued the investigation into the presence of drugs in his residence and not to release him before the search of his residence was conducted. As the police acted in accordance with the provision of the Criminal Code in detaining the appellant until his residence could be searched, he failed to establish that the detention was arbitrary. Although the appellant's residence was searched pursuant to a valid warrant, s. 24(2) of the Charter was nevertheless engaged because of the temporal connection between the officer's improper actions in entering the locked room and the evidence sought to be excluded. Notwithstanding the serious nature of the breach, to not admit the evidence in this case would have an adverse impact on the administration of justice. Possession of cocaine and marijuana for the purpose of trafficking were serious offences with serious social consequences, and the reliable evidence sought to be excluded was essential to the Crown's case. The drugs were seized pursuant to a valid search warrant for which reasonable grounds existed prior to the s. 8 breach. Had the officer never opened the locked door, the drugs inevitably would have been seized once the premises were searched pursuant to the search warrant. </summary>
