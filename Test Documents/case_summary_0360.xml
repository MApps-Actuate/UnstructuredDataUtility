<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Appeal by Igbinosun from a decision of the Appeal Panel dismissing the appellant's appeal from a decision by the Law Society finding the appellant guilty of professional misconduct and ordering his disbarment and to pay costs of $82,042. The appellant was a solicitor charged with sexual assault. The criminal charges against him were stayed due to unreasonable delay. A disciplinary proceeding commenced against the appellant. After the Law Society had represented its case but before the defence was heard, the appellant's counsel moved to be removed as solicitor of record. As the motion was granted, the appellant sought an adjournment. The Hearing Panel refused to grant the appellant an adjournment on the date of the hearing, even though the appellant agreed to proceed with new counsel after a short recess. The appellant refused to participate without counsel and the Heating Panel proceeded without the appellant. After finding the appellant guilty, the Hearing Panel sought to proceed immediately to the penalty hearing, even thought the appellant had not been provided with the required 10-day notice and the Law Society was unprepared for the penalty hearing. The appellant did not attend at the penalty hearing. On appeal, the appellant argued he as denied proper notice and that the refusal of the adjournment breached natural justice. The Appeal Panel noted that the elapsed time from the notification to the appellant of the findings against him and the onset of the penalty phase was less than half a working day and held this to be a clear breach of the principles of natural justice. However, the Panel subsequently found there had been two days notice of the penalty hearing, that this was adequate notice, and that the appellant should have been prepared to proceed with all components of his case because the date of the disciplinary hearing was peremptory to him. 	HELD: Appeal allowed. A new hearing was ordered. There was a clear breach of natural justice in proceeding to the penalty phase without adequate notice to the appellant. It was not reasonable to expect that the penalty phase would be proceeding immediately following the completion of the defence case. The notice provided to the appellant was so woefully inadequate as to constitute no notice at all. The Appeal Panel failed to analyze whether the refusal of an adjournment on the hearing date constituted a breach of natural justice or set out its conclusion in that regard. There were no findings as to whether the Hearing Panel acted judicially in refusing the adjournment or whether in all of the circumstances this constituted a breach of natural justice. To the extent the Appeal Panel's reasons constituted a finding that there was no denial of natural justice by the Hearing Panel in refusing the adjournment, the Appeal Panel erred. The right to be represented by counsel was an important one. It was not reasonable to conclude that the appellant's decision not to proceed without counsel constituted voluntary abandonment of his case. The Hearing Panel failed to act judiciously in refusing the adjournment and failed to balance the public interest in having the hearing concluded expeditiously against the very serious prejudice to the appellant of being forced to proceed in these circumstances without counsel. To the extent the Appeal Panel found to the contrary, it erred in law by failing to complete its analysis of the issue and failing to provide any reasons for its decision dismissing this aspect of the appeal. </summary>
