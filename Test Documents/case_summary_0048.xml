<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by home buyers for rescission of agreement to purchase holiday home and return of purchase price. In May 2007, the plaintiffs purchased a holiday home to be located on a designated site in a holiday resort. The purchase price included a mobile home type unit and a site in the resort, the use of which was regulated by a site agreement. The site agreement required the defendant to import the holiday home from the manufacturer in the U.S. and to set it up on the concrete pad indicated in the site agreement. The set-up involved setting the unit on blocks, removing the hitch, connecting water, sewer, electrical and propane services and skirting the underside of the structure. The holiday homes were imported into Canada with a CSA certificate certifying them as recreational vehicles. However, that designation was no longer valid as a result of the modifications made to the unit by the defendant in setting the unit on the concrete pad. The site agreement provided for the use of the site throughout the resorts open season from April 1 to October 31 and storage of the units in site during the winter. The holiday resort did not confirm to holiday park designation under the regions bylaws and at best was entitled to consideration as a non-conforming use under the region's campground designation. Consequently, the region refused to approve a phase II development of the park unless efforts were made to comply with the bylaws with respect to phase I. The plaintiffs discovered the compliance problems after a windstorm damaged their unit and they inquired as to the possibility of fixing their unit to the concrete pad. The plaintiffs repair the damage to the unit and demanded that the transaction be reversed and they be refunded their money. 	HELD: Application allowed. The breach was fundamental to what was intended by the parties. The plaintiff intended to purchase and the defendants intended to sell the advantages of the particular setting and amenities offered by the holiday resort. The fact that the occupancy of the site offered for sale was in contravention of the regional bylaws was a failure to deliver in legal form what was intended by way of the contract. The plaintiffs acted promptly in demanding rescission. The fact that the plaintiffs had used the holiday home for one season without complaint was a direct result of non-disclosure by the defendant of the non-compliance with the bylaws. </summary>
