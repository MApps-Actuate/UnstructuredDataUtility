<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Petition by Gonzalez for judicial review of a finding by the BC Human Rights Tribunal that it lacked jurisdiction to hear her complaint. The petitioner was a lawyer. She was involved in a serious motor vehicle accident that caused chronic pain and limited her to part-time work. Based on her physician's advice, the petitioner requested the courts in which she appeared to accommodate her by scheduling half days for her trials and applications. In the course of a child protection case, the petitioner and the judge engaged in a discussion regarding the conduct of the proceedings in which the judge expressed concern at the rate of progression of the hearing. When the petitioner raised the obligation of the court to accommodate her disability, the judge responded that the issue was not about her disability, but was about an efficient determination of proceedings involving children. The judge commented that the petitioner should reconsider her involvement of cases of that nature given her disability. The petitioner filed a human rights complaint. The Tribunal concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to deal with the portion of the complaint alleging discrimination by a provincial court judge on the grounds of physical disability in the areas of employment and services. The Tribunal concluded that it lacked jurisdiction on the basis that the judge's conduct was protected by judicial immunity. The petitioner submitted that the Tribunal erred in law when it concluded that her complaint was beyond its jurisdiction. 	HELD: Petition dismissed. The presiding judge did not act in a purely personal capacity when he made the allegedly discriminatory remarks to the petitioner. The remarks were made in a court room in the context of a legal proceeding in the midst of a discussion regarding the timing of the child protection case before him. The judge did not act outside of his jurisdiction or his judicial capacity. The Tribunal was thus correct when it found that it lacked jurisdiction over the petitioner's claim on the basis of judicial immunity. </summary>
