<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Trial of the accused, Jeffrey, for aggravated assault and assault with a weapon. The alleged victim suffered stab wounds to his head and abdomen during an altercation with the accused. The accused testified that he inflicted the wounds to the victim's abdomen, but contended that the hand wounds were self-inflicted. At issue was whether the accused acted in self-defence. The accused, age 25, was approximately five feet six inches in height and weighed 165 pounds. The victim, age 38, was six feet tall and weighed 185 pounds. The accused had been under the care of a psychiatrist, but no evidence was adduced regarding his mental health or capacity. The parties were among a group of people drinking outside of a townhouse. Both men were intoxicated and spent the evening arguing. Eventually, the accused and the victim went to the victim's home, possibly to engage in drug use. The victim's nephew and his girlfriend heard an argument and a fight ensue. The nephew went upstairs and saw the accused holding a knife and the victim bleeding. The victim stated that the accused stabbed him. The accused followed the nephew downstairs and asked him not to "rat him out" and to call an ambulance. The victim testified that during their argument, the accused grabbed a knife and stabbed him. He denied that they had fought prior to the stabbing. The accused testified that the fight occurred after the victim gave him money to buy drugs and he bought the wrong product. He testified that the victim began box his ears and slap him around. He testified that he grabbed the knife out of fear and stabbed the accused in the abdomen. He stated that the victim grabbed the knife and slashed his own wrists. He stated that he ran downstairs and told the nephew to call an ambulance. A large steak knife stained with blood was recovered. The accused contended he had used a smaller knife. 	HELD: Jeffrey was convicted. Both the accused and the victim gave internally inconsistent evidence that was not credible except where it was consistent with evidence given by other witnesses. The accused inflicted all of the wounds sustained by the victim using the steak knife. The medical evidence established that the victim's hand wounds were defensive in nature. The Crown proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defence of self-defence was not available under ss. 34(2) and 37 of the Criminal Code. Although the accused responded to an unlawful assault by the victim, there was a doubt as to whether the accused had a reasonable apprehension of grievous bodily harm or death and required the knife to immediately protect himself. In addition, it could not be said that the accused used no more force than was necessary, as his response with the knife on an unarmed man was disproportionate. Several other obvious alternatives were available to the accused. </summary>
