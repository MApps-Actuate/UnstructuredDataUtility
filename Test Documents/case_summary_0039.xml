<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Appeal by the accused from a sentence of six months' imprisonment for several offences arising out of the appellant's high conflict relationship with his wife after their marriage breakdown. The appellant pleaded guilty to criminal harassment, assault, mischief, attempting to obstruct justice, breaches of an undertaking and breaches of a recognizance. He was also convicted of assault causing bodily harm when he assaulted a stranger who had asked his wife to dance. The appellant argued that the sentencing judge erred in declining to accept the joint submission for a conditional sentence of 15 to 18 months. The appellant was 52 at the time of sentencing. The appellant had a criminal record which dated back some years. The judge explicitly rejected the submission that a conditional sentence could provide adequate denunciation and deterrence for the particular offences the appellant had committed. 	HELD: Appeal dismissed. Violence and spousal abuse were serious offences which required denunciatory sentences. The judge recognized correctly that a sentence emphasizing denunciation and deterrence was required in this case and to impose a conditional sentence would not have been in accord with the purposes and principles of sentencing to which he referred. The appellant's many past breaches of probation and recognizance of bail demonstrated that the appellant was unlikely to adhere to the terms of a conditional sentence if the terms did not suit his purposes. </summary>
