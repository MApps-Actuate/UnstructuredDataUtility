<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Appeal by the husband from interlocutory orders dismissing his application for an independent medical examination of the wife and declaring that the spouses had no reasonable prospect of reconciliation. The wife left the matrimonial home after 43 years of marriage. The husband argued the wife did not intend to leave the marriage and that she suffered from a delusional disorder. The husband wanted to preserve the marriage. The husband asked the wife to attend for an examination by a qualified geriatric psychiatrist in order to determine if she was suffering from delusional disorder. The wife unequivocally rejected his request. A clinical and forensic psychologist had concluded there was no reasonable prospect of reconciliation. The husband was dissatisfied with the report and sought an order that the wife be examined by a geriatric psychiatrist. The chambers judge found that there was no evidence that the wife lacked the capacity to form the intention to live separate and apart. Given that the wife had the capacity to manage her own affairs and instruct counsel, the judge reasoned, even if she suffered from delusional disorder, it would have no bearing on the issues to be determined in the divorce action and on whether the wife had established the intention to live separate and apart. 	HELD: Appeal dismissed. Disordered or delusional thinking which might contribute to an individual's intention to live separate and apart, did not diminish that individual's capacity to form that intention, provided it did not reach the level of incapacity that interfered with the ability to manage his or her own affairs and instruct counsel. Given that the wife was mentally competent, she had a higher level of capacity than that required to form an intention to live separate and apart. There was no nexus between a determination that the wife was suffering from a delusional disorder and the issue of her capacity to form the intention to live separate and apart, and such a determination would have no probative value. The fact of the wife's mental competency foreclosed the husband from challenging her statement that she intended to live separate and apart when she left the family home. </summary>
