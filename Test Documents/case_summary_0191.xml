<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>The ex-husband applied to retroactively vary a spousal support order -- He alleged there was a material change in circumstances in that he was totally disabled in an employment-related motor vehicle accident in March 2003, and that his appeal regarding a claim for workplace health, safety and compensation disability benefits was allowed, granting him $210 every two weeks -- He suggested this meant that he was no longer intentionally underemployed as found in a 1998 decision, and that he could not earn the $16,000 per year the court had imputed to him -- He further alleged that his new wife's income had decreased, and that the respondent ex-wife was now better off as she was sharing expenses with a gentleman living at her residence -- The ex-wife opposed the motion on several grounds, including that the court ought to refuse to hear the motion until his arrears were paid -- The parties had separated after 24 years of marriage -- HELD: The husband would pay $300 per month in ongoing spousal support, and his application seeking to retroactively reduce his support obligation was dismissed -- The father's annual income was $14,116 -- He presently owed $24,360 in arrears of child support -- Based on the jurisprudence, it was clear that res judicata was not a bar to the court hearing a motion made pursuant to s. 17 of the Divorce Act for variation of a support order -- The clear wording of the legislation meant that a support order was never truly a final order -- However, the court declined to retroactively vary support -- The wife still demonstrated a need, and the husband still had an ability to pay -- An appropriate order was $300 in spousal support per month -- The husband failed to satisfy the court that a retroactive variation was justified -- At no time was his income during this period from 2003-2007 less than the level it was when his support was confirmed in 1998. </summary>
