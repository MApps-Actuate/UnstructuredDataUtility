<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Appeal by Commission from decision of Human Rights Tribunal dismissing complaint alleging discriminatory dismissal from employment -- Tribunal found that Long-Term Disability offset practice aspect of complaint was an abuse of process as it was not pursued until shortly before hearing and that harassment aspect of complaint was vexatious as complainant admitted at hearing that visits from employer's representatives were not unwelcome -- Tribunal awarded costs against Commission in favour of employer -- Complainant, a crane operator, sustained work injury in 1990 and was off work since due to chronic pain -- Complainant did not permit her doctors to share reports with employer -- Employer incorrectly determined that complainant was unable to apply for long term disability benefits due to employer's offset practice, since the benefits she already received were higher than the long term benefits -- Upon realizing mistake, complainant invited to reapply in 1992, but her application was never processed for unknown reasons -- Complainant offered office position in 1994, subject to final approval by her doctor -- Knowing that she would be dismissed if she failed to fill position as there would likely not be other similar openings, complainant refused to seek doctor's approval in timely manner -- Employer dismissed complainant in 1994 for failure to cooperate and to report to alternative position offered -- Tribunal found employer acted reasonable in terminating complainant and that by making a reasonable proposal directed towards complainant's accommodation of her needs, employer had satisfied its responsibilities under Human Rights Code -- HELD: Appeal dismissed -- Tribunal did not err in finding that employer did not act unlawfully nor unreasonably in proposing office job to complainant without prior full medical assessment and in advising her about prospect of termination -- Not a breach of Code not to have full medical assessment in every case before even proposing to disabled employee a job which employer reasonably believed might be suitable for her -- Tribunal's finding that complainant was not totally disabled was supported by evidence -- After four years of inability to perform any available work, complainant had no reasonable basis for expecting to continue to be employed indefinitely unless her medical situation improved so that there was some likelihood of a return to work -- Ample evidence for Tribunal's conclusion that complainant was not a credible witness -- On present state of evidence, it would be very difficult to find that employer deliberately did not forward long term disability application in pursuance of its offset policy -- Tribunal made no palpable and overriding error or came to an unreasonable conclusion in failing to find that offset policy was applied against complainant when her second application was not processed -- Commission had not shown that police was applied -- Costs consequences in s. 41(4)(a) could be operative if complainant, but not Commission, acted in bad faith pursuing complaint -- Tribunal's factual finding of irresponsibility on part of Commission had some basis in the evidence and therefore was not unreasonable -- Tribunal's application of s. 41 to that factual conclusion not unreasonable. </summary>
