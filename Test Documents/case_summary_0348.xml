<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Motion by the plaintiff for summary judgment on a personal guarantee signed by the defendant. The defendant counterclaimed for a declaration the guarantee was null, void and of no effect. The defendant was the president and a director of UpCountry Canada Inc.,a furniture retailer. The plaintiff provided freight forwarding and warehousing services to UpCountry. The plaintiff knew Up Country was in significant financial difficulty. The defendant planned a major sale, necessitating delivery of substantial additional inventory under the control of the plaintiff. As UpCountry was substantially in arrears with its payments to the plaintiff, the plaintiff required a personal guarantee in order to release UpCountry's inventory in time for the proposed sale. 	HELD: Motion allowed. Counterclaim dismissed. There was no genuine issue for trial. Although there was a triable issue that the defendant signed the guarantee under duress, the duress was legitimate in that the plaintiff was within its right to refuse further deliveries and the defendant had the option of conducting the sale without the additional inventory. </summary>
