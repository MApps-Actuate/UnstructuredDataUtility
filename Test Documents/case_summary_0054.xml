<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Action by plaintiff companies for damages related to a collapsed agreement of purchase and sale. The plaintiffs agreed to purchase the shares in a resort from the vendor. The plaintiffs then assigned the interests in the share purchase agreement to the defendants. The plaintiffs remained liable to the vendor for the sale. When the defendants did not make proper payments under the assignment agreement, the plaintiffs brought an action for both the outstanding balance of the assignment agreement and indemnity for the settlement paid to the vendor for the collapse of the sale. 	HELD: Action allowed in part. The plaintiffs were not entitled to the outstanding balance of the assignment agreement. The agreement contained provisions which provided for the forfeiture of the deposit as damages for termination of the agreement. The forfeiture clauses were the parties' attempt to fix the amount payable to the plaintiffs if the defendants did not complete the transaction. The plaintiffs were entitled to their claim for indemnity in relation to their settlement with the vendor. The plaintiffs took reasonable steps in mitigation by reaching a settlement with the vendor. </summary>
