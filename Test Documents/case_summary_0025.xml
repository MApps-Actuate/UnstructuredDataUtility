<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Appeal by defendants from a decision of a chambers judge dismissing the appellant's application to have a Mareva injunction and Anton Piller order set aside. The respondent Crown commenced an action against the appellants to recover monies it had advanced to fund defence costs of the appellant Malik for the Air India trial. Malik had been charged in connection with the Air India bombing. Malik agreed in a Payment Agreement that he was indebted to the Crown for all payments made by the Crown under the Defence Counsel Agreement which required Malik to transfer all of his assets to the Crown. Malik failed to comply with the agreement and applied for relief should the Crown not continue to fund his defence costs. The application was dismissed on the basis that Malik failed to establish that he was not in a position to contribute to the funding of his defence costs. The Crown argued that the appellants were bound by the findings made on Malik's funding application. In dismissing the application to have the orders set aside, the chambers judge relied on all findings of fact made in Malik's funding application. 	HELD: Appeal allowed in part. The Mareva injunction was set aside as against the defendants other than Malik. The Anton Piller order was set aside. The chambers judge should not have relied on all of the findings in the funding application in order to support the granting of the Mareva injunction. The injunction was, however, supportable against Malik on the basis that he agreed as part of the Defence Counsel Agreement to transfer his assets to the Crown. The only findings from the finding application admissible on the application for the Mareva injunction were the findings that Malik could look to his own assets to raise funds, that Malik could look to the income and assets of his family to fund his defence costs because their assets were fused and that, as a result, Malik had the means to pay for his defence costs. The remaining findings were not admissible because the doctrines of issue estoppel and abuse of process did not prevent the defendants from relitigating those facts. The admissible findings, together with the supplemental facts contained in the Crown's affidavits, did not establish a strong prima facie case of fraud or a real risk of dissipation of assets by the appellants. The Crown had a prima facie claim that it was entitled to either a constructive trust or an equitable charge in respect of Malik's assets. A refusal to restrain Malik from transferring or encumbering his assets could cause irreparable harm to the Crown. Subject to any defences Mr. Malik may have, the Crown is entitled to look to his assets for recovery of the funds it advanced under the Defence Counsel Agreement. The injunction was reasonably necessary to preserve Malik's assets pending a determination of the Crown's claims. The Anton Piller order should not have been granted on the basis of the admissible evidence before the court. The admissible evidence did not establish a strong prima facie case of fraud or show a real possibility the appellants would destroy any incriminating documents that might be in their possession. </summary>
