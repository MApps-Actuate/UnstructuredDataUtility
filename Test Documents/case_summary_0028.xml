<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Appeal by the Crown from dismissal of its application on the eve of the bankruptcy of LeRoy Trucking to have funds being held in trust paid to the Receiver General for Canada. LeRoy Trucking obtained an order under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act staying all proceedings while it attempted to restructure its financial affairs, and an accounting firm was appointed as Monitor. LeRoy Trucking owed the Crown $305,202 in GST collected from third parties. LeRoy Trucking had been authorized by the court to conduct sales of its redundant equipment, and it applied on April 29, 2008 for court approval of the distribution of the sale proceeds. It proposed that, subject to a holdback of the $305,202 owed to the Crown on account of GST, an amount not exceeding $5 million be paid to Century Services, its major secured creditor. Over the objection of the Crown, which wanted the monies paid directly to it, the chambers judge agreed with the proposal and ordered that the Monitor hold the sum of $305,202 in its trust account pending further order of the court. No appeal was taken by the Crown from this order. LeRoy Trucking eventually came to the realization that it could not successfully reorganize its financial affairs and applied for court approval of the distribution of further sale proceeds and for leave to assign itself into bankruptcy. The Crown applied on the same day for an order that the monies held in trust by the Monitor be paid to the Receiver General. The chambers judge heard LeRoy Trucking's application first and granted it; he then heard and dismissed the Crown's application. 	HELD: Appeal allowed. The funds paid into the trust account of the Monitor, together with interest earned thereon, were ordered to be paid to the Receiver General. While the chambers judge had the authority to stay the Crown's right to enforce the deemed trust created by s. 222(3) of the Excise Tax Act during the period in which LeRoy Trucking attempted to reorganize its financial affairs, after the restructuring efforts came to an end he did not have the discretion to ignore the deemed trust under s. 222 or the express trust that was created in favour of the Crown when LeRoy Trucking paid the funds into the trust account of the Monitor. </summary>
