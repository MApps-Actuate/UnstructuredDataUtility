<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Motion by the plaintiff Builders' Supplies for summary judgment against the defendant Cromax Drywall. Cromax was a subcontractor on a building project. A balance remained outstanding after Cromax had made payments. Cromax admitted that there was an outstanding balance but argued that it had verbally agreed with Builders' Supplies to pay when Cromax was paid. Cromax claimed that since it had not been paid by the general contractor, Builders' Supplies was not entitled to judgment at this time. Cromax also disputed the amount owing. 	HELD: Motion allowed. The evidence did not support Cromax's contention that there was a pay when paid agreement between the parties. Even if Cromax's evidence on this issue was accepted, Cromax did not assert that Cromax's oral statement "you get paid when I get paid" was accepted by Builders' representative. Cromax had no chance of success with its position and it did not constitute a genuine issue for trial. Cromax also did not raise a genuine issue for trial with respect to the amount claimed by Builders'. </summary>
