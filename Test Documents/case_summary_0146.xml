<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>In this trial de novo from a decision of a small claims adjudicator, the claimants sought $3,813 in damages arising from a breach of contract with respect to the installation of a new liner in their in-ground swimming pool -- During the initial installation, the defendants were unable to remove certain wrinkles -- Although they pledged to return and correct the error, they never did -- The plaintiffs sought recovery of the amounts paid for the liner, and the costs of repairs made by another pool company -- HELD: The plaintiffs were awarded $2,275 plus $100 as recovery of the filing fee -- The new liner as installed was not fit for the purpose intended -- The claimants had contracted for a new liner and the defendants had agreed to provide one that was free from the defects that obviously remained -- The defects in the liner went to the root of the contract and the new liner was not of a standard acceptable within the defendant's contractual obligation -- The claimants were entitled to rescind the contract and obtain return of the purchase price paid -- The evidence was clear that the defendant was given every opportunity to fix the problem -- The plaintiffs were not bound to return the product as it could not be returned without considerable cost and inconvenience -- One-quarter of the purchase price was deducted as the plaintiffs had had two seasons' use from the liner. </summary>
