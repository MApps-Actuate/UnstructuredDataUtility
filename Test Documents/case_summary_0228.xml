<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>This was an application for a remedy under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms by an engineer charged under section 31(2) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act with giving advice that caused a worker to be endangered. The accused complained that his rights had been infringed because he would be tried by a justice of the peace and a justice of the peace was not competent to try him. Section 68(2) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act allowed the Attorney General but not the accused to elect to have the offence tried by a judge. The accused's prior application to have a judge appointed under section 36 of the Courts of Justice Act had been dismissed. He sought to have this decision quashed. 	HELD: The application was dismissed without costs. The application should not have proceeded. Section 68(2) did not infringe the accused engineer's rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. </summary>
