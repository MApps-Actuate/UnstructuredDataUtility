<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Motion by the husband for reduction in child support retroactive to 2004 and to terminate or not increase his obligation to contribute towards child care expenses. The wife sought to have child support increased to 552 based on the husband's imputed annual income of $37,000. She further requested that his monthly payment towards child care costs be increased to $318per month based on monthly child care costs of $800 with her income being $56,000 per year and his being $37,000.00 per year. The parties married in 1992 and separated in 1997. They had two children aged 13 and 11. The youngest child had significant special needs and required supervision at all times. The wife had custody. At the time of the divorce in 2001, the husband was ordered to pay $506 per month in child support based on his annual income of $35,000 plus $144 per month in special expenses. The husband was terminated from his employment in 2004 and decided not to return to work after grieving his termination. A temporary consent order in 2005 reduced child support to $302 per month. The husband started a home renovation business in 2005 earning $23,896 in 2005 and $30,208 in 2006. The wife argued the husband was underemployed and that the court should impute income of $37,000 to him. 	HELD: Motion allowed in part. The consequences of the husband's decision not to return to his job should not be borne by the children. It was reasonable to impute his 2004 salary of $37,000 to him. He was thus ordered to pay $552 per month in child support. The wife did not provide any documentation of her child care costs. She thus made the decision to forego an order that the husband pay the proportionate share of the child care expenses she incurred in 2006 and 2007. The issue of ongoing child care costs was adjourned to allow the wife to provide further evidence. There was no doubt that the wife incurred child care costs. The husband was to continue paying the amount of $144 previously ordered. </summary>
