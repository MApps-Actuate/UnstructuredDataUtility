<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by the Residents for leave to appeal a decision of the Ontario Municipal Board (OMB) which denied the Residents' motion for an order consolidating proceedings related to a development project proposed by Westhill. The proposed development involved an 18 hole golf course, clubhouse and condominium complex. Since the lands were not serviced by municipal sewers and water, new infrastructure was needed to implement the development. The Residents were concerned about the protection of surface and groundwater resources. After the parties made submissions to the OMB, the OMB decided that consolidation of the matters involved was not justified. The Residents took the position that the OMB's decision was incorrect in law and that if the matters were heard separately, approvals may not be consistent. In contrast, Westhill took the position that the OMB properly exercised its jurisdiction and discretion in finding that the criteria for an order for consolidation were not met. 	HELD: Application allowed. The OMB did not consider the scheme of the legislation and the benefits of consolidating proceedings in the present circumstances. Therefore, the correctness of the decision was open to very serious debate. Furthermore, the matters raised were of broad significance and warranted resolution by a higher level of judicial authority. </summary>
