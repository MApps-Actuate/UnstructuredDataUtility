<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by Ferguson for leave to appeal from a decision by a judge in small claims court, dismissing his action against Liaison Electronique, Vienneau and Losier. Ferguson's wife purchased a power supply for a telephone from Liaison which did not function properly at the couple's cottage 45 minutes away. Ferguson commenced a small claims court action against Liaison, alleging he was refused a refund for the product by the store's clerk, Losier. Ferguson also named Losier and Vienneau, the store's owner. The judge found the power supply worked fine in the community where it was purchased, and found it fatal to Ferguson's claim that he failed to inform Liaison that he intended to use the product at his cottage. 	HELD: Application allowed. Ferguson raised a question of law regarding whether or not he was required to disclose the intended location of his use of the product in order to avail himself of the product warranty. Ferguson was not granted leave to appeal from the dismissal of his action against the store clerk. </summary>
