<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>The appellant appealed his conviction for driving while over the legal limit, for which he was fined $850 and ordered to pay a $125 victim fine surcharge -- He argued that the trial judge erred in finding that the violation of his s. 10 Charter right was "minor" and that he further erred by failing to exclude from evidence the breathalyser certificate -- The trial judge found that the arresting officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make the breath sample, and that the accused had access to legal counsel, albeit not the counsel of his choice -- It was conceded that the appellant failed to explicitly mention the name of the specific counsel he wished to speak with to the officer, or to mention that he wished to contact counsel of choice -- The defence testified that the 21-year-old appellant felt rushed and was intimidated by the officer, which is why he did not speak up -- HELD: The appeal was dismissed -- In this case the appellant had not asserted his right to private counsel -- The court did not agree with the trial judge's finding that his s. 10(b) right had been violated, but it did agree with the final verdict of guilty -- Although the police were to take all reasonable efforts to afford the accused his right to counsel of his choice, that was difficult or impossible if the appellant did not ask the officer to assist him to place the call -- A detainee had to be reasonably diligent in exercising his right to counsel of his choice -- The appellant had given the samples voluntarily and he had spoken to a duty counsel lawyer before giving the samples. </summary>
