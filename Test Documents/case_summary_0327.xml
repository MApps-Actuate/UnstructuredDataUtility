<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Motion by the defendant to strike out the statement of claim on the ground that it disclosed no cause of action. The plaintiff was a licensed nurse. The defendant was a medical practitioner. The plaintiff alleged that an interim licence suspension resulted from the defendant's opinion about the plaintiff's incapacity to practice her profession due to an alcohol dependency. The opinion was rendered after the defendant was appointed by the College of Nursing to report on the plaintiff's capacity as a nurse. The defendant argued that by virtue of his appointment and the statutory protections afforded by the Regulated Health Professions Act and the Health Professions Procedural Code, they were a complete defence to civil suit. A joint and independent medical review concluded that the defendant's tests performed were incomplete conclusions reached without a sound medical foundation and constituted bad faith. As a result of these findings, the plaintiff was immediately reinstated. The plaintiff then commenced the present action for malicious prosecution, misfeasance of public office, abuse of public office, negligence, and interference with economic relations. 	HELD: Motion dismissed. The claim for malicious prosecution was struck as the defendant did not initiate any proceedings against the plaintiff. On the claims of misfeasance in public office, abuse of public office, negligence and interference with economic relations, it was premature at this stage to conclude that these claims disclosed no cause of action. The tort of misfeasance in public office and abuse of power was a developmental area of the law. Much was dependant on whether immunity applied where the actions of the defendant were construed to have been carried out in bad faith, as well as whether the defendant was cloaked with the title public official. The claim for interference with economic relations would succeed or fail depending on whether any of these causes of action succeeded. </summary>
