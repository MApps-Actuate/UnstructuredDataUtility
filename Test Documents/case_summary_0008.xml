<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Action by employee for damages for constructive dismissal. The plaintiff, aged 61, claimed that he was constructively dismissed from his management position with the defendant and was entitled to damages equivalent to notice of 22 months. The plaintiff spent his entire working life in the forest industry. In 1978, he began working for Weldwood of Canada, which was acquired by the defendant in 2005. The plaintiff started as a foreman with Weldwood and ultimately moved up to the position of production superintendent where he had nine supervisors reporting to him and was responsible for approximately 100 employees. Prior to Weldwood being acquired by the defendant, the employee had discussions with the defendant with respect to the proposed acquisition and his place in the company. He was aware that his department would no longer exist after the take over and indicated that he planned to retire in three to five years and would be willing to consider other jobs including short-term jobs with the company. After the defendant's acquisition of Weldwood, the employee continued to do the same work he had done for Weldwood and his salary, benefits and job title remained unchanged. However, some changes were made in that certain individuals no longer reported to him and he was not required to prepare budgets and consequently no longer received financial information about the company. By April 2005, the employee's management responsibilities disappeared as the employees he had been supervising were either terminated or reassigned to other positions. The employee did not complain about the changes that had been made to his job and he did not indicate to his superiors that the changes were unacceptable. At a meeting with his superior in November 2005, the employee was asked if there was any direction he wanted to see his job go in and did not, at that time, indicate that he wanted a management role, but rather indicated that he wanted a job in which he could be productive. The employee's evidence was at the time of the meeting he felt like his job had disappeared and that if the defendant was not going to give him the kind of defined role he felt he deserved, he should have been offered a severance package, but he did not communicate this to his superior. At a meeting in 2006, the employee was given his management bonus cheque and advised that it was probably the last one he would receive as the bonus system was being phased out. In addition, the employee indicated that he was willing to consider any job and did not insist on a management position. In January 2007, the employee, unhappy with his Christmas bonus cheque, attempted to initiate discussions with his superiors and sent a letter to his superior indicating his unhappiness and outlining his options, one of which was to resign. Following a meeting with his superiors and a discussion with his wife, the employee sent a letter to the defendant indicating that he would be resigning. In June 2007, the employee sold his home and retired to Victoria. He made some meager attempts to find employment in Victoria, but appeared to be primarily interested in retirement, and had not been employed since he resigned from the defendant in March 2007. 	HELD: Action dismissed. The employee was not constructively dismissed. The terms of the employee's contract permitted the employer to unilaterally assign, within reason, different or new duties to the employee without any corresponding increase in salary or position level and also permitted the employer to remove responsibilities as the employer saw fit. It was not a term of the employee's contract that he receive a certain level of bonus each year or that he was guaranteed a bonus each year. The employer did not breach any essential term of the contract by eliminating or removing management or supervisory tasks from the employee. Even if the employer's conduct had breached the terms of the employment contract, the employee, by his conduct, elected not to treat the changes as a repudiation of his employment contract and the employee failed to communicate within a reasonable time that he accepted the employer's repudiation. </summary>
