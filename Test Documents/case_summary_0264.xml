<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Motion by Ritchie for leave to introduce new evidence on appeal. Ritchie had given photographs to Saw Mill Creek. Ritchie claimed that he had imposed a restriction on the photos and advised Saw Mill Creek of his copyright in the photos. Saw Mill Creek claimed that he gave them the photos unconditionally. The trial judge preferred Saw Mill Creek's evidence and found against Ritchie. Ritchie sought to introduce fresh evidence to show that the trial judge had erred as to the date of the delivery of the photos and therefore may have also erred in finding that he had given the photos with no restrictions. 	HELD: Motion dismissed. The fresh evidence was not accepted at the appeal. It was not possible to ascertain the credibility of the evidence. The evidence could probably have been obtained before trial with the exercise of reasonable due diligence. It was not clear that the evidence would have been conclusive of an issue in the appeal. </summary>
