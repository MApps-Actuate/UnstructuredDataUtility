<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>The accused was charged with three counts of failing to comply with notices to provide completed individual tax returns for 1999-2001 -- HELD: The accused was convicted on all three counts -- He was personally served with three requirements to file the completed tax returns before June 30, 2003 and filed no such returns -- Where the accused had actual knowledge of the location of the Toronto tax office on Front Street and of his contact's phone number, he could not point to a typographical error on the face of the requirement to claim officially induced error -- Having received no indication from Sudbury of any filing by the accused for the relevant years, nor any filed returns from any other office, the court found the contact, Redvers, was entitled to rely on the system in place to verify the physical search of his own files, and that what he did constituted a "careful examination and search of the appropriate records" -- The admitted 1999 filing was not a valid tax return as it contained no statement of income or assets. </summary>
