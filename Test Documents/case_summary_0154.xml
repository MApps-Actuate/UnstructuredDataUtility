<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by Black to sever her charges from those of her co-accused pursuant to s. 591(3) of the Criminal Code. The 77-year-old applicant was charged, along with her son, with conspiracy to launder proceeds of crime and laundering the proceeds of crime. Her son was also charged with additional offences. The allegations involved a voluminous amount of disclosure and the trial was expected to last six weeks. The applicant argued that to be subjected to a six-week trial would impose a tremendous burden both from a health perspective and from a financial perspective. The two main grounds for severance were (1) that because she was co-accused with her son, he was not a compellable witness and the applicant would be deprived of the benefit of his evidence at trial and (2) that the applicant would be required to participate in a long and expensive legal proceeding when her implication could be described as marginal when compared to that of the co-accused. 	HELD: Application dismissed. It was well settled law that, as a general rule, persons who were accused of a crime that arose out of the same set of facts should be tried together. Severance should only be granted where it was shown on a balance of probabilities that to refuse to do so would result in an injustice to the accused. Where an accused sought severance on the ground that testimony from a co-accused would be necessary to make full answer and defence, the court had consider the following: was there a reasonable possibility that the co-accused, if made compellable by severance, would testify, and, (2) If the co-accused would testify, as there a reasonable possibility that the co-accused's evidence could affect the verdict in a manner favorable to the accused seeking severance. Here, The only evidence presented concerning the testimony that the co-accused might give was the observation that it would be reasonable to assume that he would be prepared to testify at a separate trial and that his testimony w ould be favorable to the applicant, given their relationship. Although the co-accused was not a compellable witness in the current proceedings, he was still a competent witness. Further, the Court was not convinced that the joint proceedings would be so lengthy that to deny severance would result in an injustice to the accused. </summary>
