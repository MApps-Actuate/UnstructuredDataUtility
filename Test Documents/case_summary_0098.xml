<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Appeal by the plaintiff from an order declaring a mistrial. The appellant had sued the respondents for personal injuries resulting from a motor vehicle accident. Liability had been admitted. The mistrial was declared because the comments made in the opening of plaintiff's counsel, that the respondent had breached the rules of the road and fell asleep at the wheel, were such as to create an atmosphere of sympathy for the appellant. The appellant argued the trial judge's criticism was unfounded and could have been cured by a jury instruction. 	HELD: Appeal dismissed. Once liability was admitted without qualification, the only issues remaining were the cause of the appellant's injuries and the quantum of his damages. The trial was an assessment of damages and nothing more. In expressing his personal belief in the strength of the appellant's case by indicating that he had satisfied himself that the injuries suffered were real, serious, and permanent and they had caused, and would in the future cause, real losses, counsel was in effect giving evidence. Such statements constituted inadmissible evidence that could never be challenged about the appellant's injuries and his losses. It was not an assertion the jury could be expected to completely ignore no matter what they were told, and it bore directly on the fairness of the trial. </summary>
