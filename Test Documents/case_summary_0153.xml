<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Appeal by the Crown from the acquittal of the accused for driving with an illegal blood-alcohol level -- Police stopped the accused, issued a demand for a breath test, and took the accused to the detachment -- The accused was taken to a different detachment due to unavailability of a technician -- The officer was the sole witness at trial, and at no time mentioned that the events he described took place in New Brunswick -- His testimony mentioned that he was on patrol in Nackawic, that the driver produced a New Brunswick driver's licence and stated that he was from Fredericton, and that he went from the Woodstock to the Nackawic detachment -- The officer further mentioned street names, and that duty counsel was provided by the province of New Brunswick -- Following trial, the Crown conceded that there was insufficient evidence to form the basis of an impaired driving conviction -- The trial judge found that the screening device test was taken forthwith -- However, the judge held that references to place names in the evidence were not specific enough to allow him to take judicial notice that the offence occurred within the territorial jurisdiction of the court -- The Crown submitted that the judge erred in law -- HELD: Appeal allowed -- There was sufficient evidence comprised of geographical references for the trial judge to take judicial notice that the offence occurred in New Brunswick -- Even if the judge was not satisfied that the references met the test of notoriety, he should have resorted to readily accessible accurate sources -- A map would have confirmed that the places mentioned by the officer were all in New Brunswick, and that the offence took place in New Brunswick -- The offence was otherwise proven and a conviction was accordingly entered. </summary>
