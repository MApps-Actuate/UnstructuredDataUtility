<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Action by Matuzich, her parents, and her sister, against two doctors and a hospital, for damages for failure to inform her of the risks of surgery. Matuzich was an otherwise healthy 21- year-old woman who agreed to have anterior laparoscopic spinal surgery to correct degenerative disc disease. She had previously declined traditional spinal surgery due to the small risk of paralysis. After consulting several doctors, she agreed to have two surgeons perform the laparoscopic surgery. This involved accessing the spine through the abdomen. Shortly after the procedure began, she suffered significant internal bleeding. Her abdomen had to be completely opened from sternum to pubis in order to repair lacerations to her aorta and bowel. She spent two weeks in hospital recovering, and suffered weight loss, loss of appetite and bowel problems for the following year, and a permanent significant scar on her abdomen. At trial, Matuzich and her parents testified that they had not been advised of the risk of a blood vessel or bowel injury when they consented to the surgery. The doctors testified that Matuzich was advised of these risks. 	HELD: Action allowed. The evidence established that the doctors explained the risk of bowel and blood vessel injury. However, the doctors left the impression that these risks were very small. In fact, there was a 10 to 15 per cent risk that the laparoscopic surgery would need to be converted to open abdominal surgery, and Matuzich was not told this. An explanation of risk required an explanation of the procedure and the injuries that might occur, the frequency or likelihood of that risk materializing, and the consequences of the injuries should they occur. The physicians failed to tell Matuzich that a major blood vessel could be cut, and that her life could be in jeopardy if that occurred. Matuzich would not have undergone this surgery had she been aware of the risks, nor would a reasonable person in her position. General damages were assessed at $65,000 to Matuzich, $3,500 to each of her parents and $2,000 to her sister. </summary>
