<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by the wife against the respondent husband for sole custody. The parties were married in 1992. They had a nine-year-old daughter and an eight-year-old son. The parties enjoyed sexual encounters with other individuals or couples within their ongoing relationship. In 2002 they met another couple who had the same lifestyle. The two couples became involved together with the eventual result that they separated. The wife lived with the husband from the other couple while the husband dated the other couple's wife. The children spent one week with the wife and the next week with the father in the matrimonial home. The husband wanted the joint custody arrangement to continue. 	HELD: Application allowed. The wife was granted interim sole custody and the primary residence of the children would be with her. There was a greater likelihood that the children would develop and maintain a strong relationship with both parents if they lived with the wife and had access with the husband. The husband had alienated the children from the wife and blamed her for the marriage breakdown. </summary>
