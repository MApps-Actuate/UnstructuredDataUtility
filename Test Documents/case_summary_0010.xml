<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by the plaintiff to add a defendant and make consequential amendments to amended statement of claim. The action arose from treatment the plaintiff received while incarcerated in the Vancouver city jail and the pre-trial detention centre in May 2004. The plaintiff was paraplegic and alleged his paraplegia was caused by the negligent care, diagnosis, treatment and advice of three doctors and seven nurses. During discoveries, one of the doctors discovered stated that he had filled out a requisition for blood work, although there was no record of blood work having been undertaken or results of blood work being provided. The proposed defendant, B.C. Biomedical Laboratories Ltd. had a contract with the pre-trial centre to provide testing services. In April 2008, the plaintiff brought his motion to add B.C. Biomedical Laboratories Ltd. as a defendant. The plaintiff sought to add B.C. Biomedical Laboratories Ltd. as a defendant on the basis that a duty of care could be found from its contractual undertaking to the Crown, that it failed to meet its contractual obligations to provide caregivers at the pre-trial centre with the plaintiffs blood test results and that it was reasonably foreseeable that such failure could cause the plaintiff's caregivers to misdiagnose and/or mistreat the plaintiff. The limitation period had expired as the incident in which it was alleged that the proposed defendant was involved took place in May 2004. A representative of the proposed defendant was examined and she stated that she had no independent recollection of the alleged events and that the original requisitions for blood work for the day in question had been destroyed in June 2007 in the usual course of business. 	HELD: Application dismissed. It was not just and that the issue as intended to be pleaded in the amended statement of claim be determined in the proceedings considering the time that had elapsed, the tenuous connection between the plaintiff and the proposed defendant, the prejudice to the proposed defendant as a result of the destruction of documents and that the representative of the proposed defendant had no independent memory of the alleged events. Furthermore, there was no adequate explanation for failing to add the proposed defendant as a defendant within the limitation period. The likelihood of an application being brought to add the proposed defendant as a third party by one or more of the named defendants was not an appropriate or necessary consideration in determining whether proposed defendant should be added as a defendant. </summary>
