<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>This was a motion by the Plaintiff, TW, to compel the defendant, Seo, to provide answers to certain questions which he refused to answer at his examination for discovery and to answer proper questions arising out of his undertakings. The action arose out of a claim for damages arising out of TW's attendance for a pelvic ultrasound test conducted by Seo which she alleged amounted to an assault and because she was allegedly video taped at the time she was undressed. Seo had been charged with a criminal offence arising out of the incident. TW sought production of Seo's income tax returns in order to determine if he could satisfy her claim for punitive and exemplary damages. She also sought information concerning non-parties to the proceedings and certain issues in the criminal matter. 	HELD: Motion dismissed. TW would suffer no prejudice by the non-disclosure of Seo's tax returns. The information was not relevant or required for the presentation of her case. As no repetitive conduct was alleged in the Claim, the information regarding non-parties had no semblance of relevance to the proceedings. TW had presented no evidence to support her request for answers to questions concerning the criminal matter. </summary>
