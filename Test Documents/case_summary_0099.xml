<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Petition by Todd for a declaration that the election of the respondent, Coleridge, was invalid. The parties were candidates for councillor in the local election for the City of White Rock. During the election, the respondent participated in concealing the identity of the author of a contentious email sent to all candidates. The email made reference to a pro-development slate of candidates that included the petitioner. The email contained an attachment that described the manner in which each of the candidates had supported the development of high-rise buildings in the community. Further email exchanges involved the petitioner and the respondent, both as himself and using a pseudonym. In the local press, the respondent denied that he knew the author of the emails. When confronted with information that they originated from his home, he denied knowledge and contended he was a victim of identity theft. The respondent was successfully elected. The petitioner lost his seat. At the hearing, the respondent testified that the email was drafted and sent by his wife under a pseudonym without his knowledge. He admitted that he had previously drafted the attachment and had collected information regarding the purported slate of candidates and their ties to real estate development. The petitioner alleged that the respondent either authored or authorized the publication of an email in which misleading and untrue accusations were leveled against political rivals, and then knowingly made false statements about the authorship of the email. The petitioner submitted that the respondent's conduct violated s. 152 of the Local Government Act and warranted invalidation of the respondent's election. The respondent submitted that any misrepresentations he made were not material. 	HELD: Petition allowed. The respondent participated in the creation of a fictitious couple that he used to support his platform and lied about his knowledge of the couple. He continued his deception with local media under the pretence that the couple was concerned citizens who supported his viewpoint. He further continued his deception despite being presented with an occasion to tell the truth. The respondent thus used the decision to further his own political ends. Since the respondent put his character, integrity and honesty in issue, it constituted a material fact. His conduct amounted to a misrepresentation of a material fact that warranted invalidation of the respondent's election. The office was declared vacant. The respondent was ordered to pay the City $20,000 to the cost of running a by-election. The petitioner was awarded his costs payable by the City. </summary>
