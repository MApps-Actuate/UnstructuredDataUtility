<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>The accused was charged with obstruction of justice in a judicial proceeding by destruction of evidence, and with being an accessory after the fact to murder -- Although the Crown asserted that the evidence collectively supported a conviction on both counts, it sought a conviction on only one charge -- With respect to the count of obstructing justice, it was alleged that the accused had cleaned up blood in his apartment, which was the scene of the crime -- The defence argued that his explanation that he cleaned up the blood because it was gross was sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt about his intent -- HELD: The accused was convicted of obstruction of justice while a stay was entered on the second count -- The attempt to clean the blood was linked to the legal proceedings that could be expected to follow the events that occurred -- The destruction of evidence by throwing it off the bridge would have a tendency to obstruct, pervert or defeat the course of justice -- Given that the accused and the three men who had just beaten the victim left together and drove to the bridge to throw the towels over it, it was not reasonable to infer anything other than that the accused had the intent to obstruct justice. </summary>
