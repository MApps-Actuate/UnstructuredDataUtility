<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Trial of Wolfe and Campbell on a charge of theft over $200. The defence was whether the incident amounted to theft. Hayes delivered works of art that he had prepared, one print of a Polish tall ship and one sketch of the Bluenose, to Elgin Blueprint to make 50 copies of each. Elgin referred him to a London business that subcontracted the job to a firm operated by one of the accused and where the other worked. The prints were made and delivered to Hayes who found that only 80 copies were appropriate for distribution. He retained them in his possession. However, on a weekend in August, some parties were selling these prints and were observed by persons, including Geisler, who, in order to eliminate the competition, bought all the prints from Campbell at $1.50 per print. He put them on sale himself for $4. Before that, Campbell sold at least one print for $3. Geisler had some 60 in his possession. Some copies were found in Wolfe's premises. 	HELD: Wolfe and Campbell found guilty. They were involved in the preparation and distribution of the prints. They produced extra copies and sold them on their own. Hayes had copyright in the prints that were artistic work within the definition of the Copyright Act. Campbell and Wolfe violated the right that copyright gave to Hayes. No defence was raised that could raise a reasonable doubt. The Crown made out its case. </summary>
