<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by the Catholic Children's Aid Society of Toronto to admit certain hearsay documents as business records or as evidence of past conduct towards children. The records consisted of the respondent father's criminal record, arrest records, occurrence reports, supplementary arrest records and a synopsis of his guilty pleas. The latter document presented a police summary of allegations in the event of a plea. There was no evidence that the father agreed to these facts. The document brief also included a lengthy record of the family's involvement with the Society over a six-year period. These documents consisted of opening, closing, transfer and progress reports, emergency after-hour reports or service requests, individual service logs and risk assessment reports. 	HELD: Application allowed in part. Most of the police records were admissible under the business records exception to the hearsay rule. Only the supplementary arrest records and the synopsis of guilty pleas were excluded. The supplementary records included a summary of hearsay from third party complainants. They also contained opinions on irrelevant bail issues. The synopsis was excluded because the father did not agree to these facts. The opening, closing, transfer and progress reports were excluded. They were not made contemporaneously with the recorded event or shortly afterwards. The risk assessment reports were excluded because they did not record events. They purported to express an expert opinion on further risk. Such opinion could only be admitted after compliance with the expert evidence rules. The other Society records were admitted as business records. The opening, closing, transfer and progress reports were admitted as evidence of past conduct towards children. No weight was given to the risk assessment reports or recorded comments of third parties unless they were confirmed by the parents or other admissible evidence. The admission of the historical records was not contrary to the principles of fundamental justice contained in section 7 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. </summary>
