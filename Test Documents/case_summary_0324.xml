<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Motion by the defendants for a second defence medical examination. The plaintiffs sued the defendants for personal injuries suffered in a motor vehicle accident. Prior to the plaintiff's examination for discovery, the defendant obtained a defence medical of the plaintiff which indicated that there was no objective evidence to indicate any residual impairment related to any musculo-ligamentus injury that may have been suffered by the plaintiff in the accident. At the pre-trial, the plaintiff indicated he would pursue a future wage loss claim on the ground that the completion of his Masters degree was delayed as a result of accident related injuries. As a result of the plaintiff's change in position, the parties sent all new medical information to the physician who prepared another report indicating that his earlier opinion had not changed. 	HELD: Motion dismissed. There was no indication that the plaintiff's medical condition had changed significantly. A second defence examination was thus unwarranted. </summary>
