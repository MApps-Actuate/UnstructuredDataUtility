<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Motion by the defendants seeking "direction with respect to the conduct of the within Appeal" on the grounds that the "[t]he appeal involve[d] substantial evidence that [was] contained in the transcript, which [was] before the Court, but not in possession of the Appellant or Respondents". As required by Rule 62.11, the appellant ordered "all the necessary evidence", which included a transcript of the trial proceedings. On June 4, 2007, the court reporter advised that the total cost of transcribing the evidence amounted to $15,058, including HST. An invoice in that amount was forwarded to the appellants' counsel. None of the parties to the appeal purchased the transcript. 	HELD: The parties were directed to comply with the Practice Direction relating to Books of Essential References. In their written submission, the parties made significant reference to the evidence without complying with Rules 62.14(2) and 62.19(2), which respectively required the appellants and the respondents to set out the relevant facts "with such references to the evidence as may be necessary". Reference to the evidence contained in the transcript at the hearing was inevitable. </summary>
