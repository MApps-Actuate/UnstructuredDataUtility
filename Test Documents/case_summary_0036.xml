<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by Manji for leave to appeal from an order permitting three further independent medical examinations in her action against the Chandras and five further examinations in her action against Doorandish. The actions arose from two motor vehicle accidents which took place ten years apart. The judge noted that the cases were particularly medically and factually complex and tried to balance Manji's special needs with the need for the defendants to properly investigate her claims. The judge found that Manji's was an exceptional case in which several independent medical examinations were necessary. 	HELD: Application dismissed. Manji's appeal raised no points of significance to the underlying actions and had little chance of success. By the time the appeal was heard, Manji had already attended three of the ordered examinations. Allowing her appeal would hinder the progress of the trials in her actions. </summary>
