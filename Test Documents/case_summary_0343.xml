<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Determination of how agreement should be performed, interest, issue of undertaking as to damages and other relief. After a trial of the issues in the matter, the court ordered specific performance of an agreement between the parties, namely that the defendant sell 100,000 common shares of the Bourse de Montreal to the plaintiff for $50 per share. Before the agreement could be performed, the Bourse de Montreal and the Toronto Stock Exchange amalgamated and the defendant received 136,187 Toronto Stock Exchange shares and $4,876,995 in cash. The position of the defendant was that the agreement could not now be performed and the court should order damages at common law rather than specific performance. 	HELD: There was no new evidence that would justify a change in the order. The agreement between the parties was unconditional and involved an exchange of cash for shares. It was fair and feasible to implement the specific performance order by compelling the defendant to transfer to the plaintiff the Toronto Stock Exchange shares and the cash it received for which the defendant was to pay $5 million plus interest. The defendant was also to pay to the plaintiff an amount equal to the total amount of dividends paid on the shares to the date of judgement plus prejudgment interest and an amount equal to the total amount of dividends paid after the date of judgement to the date of performance of the agreement plus pre-judgment interest. The plaintiff was to pay pre-judgment interest on the $5 million. Remaining issues of notice of application to be adjourned sine die. </summary>
