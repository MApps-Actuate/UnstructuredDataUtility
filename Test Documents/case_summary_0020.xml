<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by the Crown to admit a series of videotaped statements into evidence at the trial of Vaughn on two charges of sexual assault. The two child complainants gave the statements to the investigating officer. The Crown sought the admission of the statements in advance of the preliminary hearing to obtain a committal without having to call the children to give viva voce testimony. Vaughn opposed the admission of the statements, and if the statements were admitted, sought to cross-examine the complainants. 	HELD: Application dismissed. A voir dire was required to assess the credibility and trustworthiness of the statements prior to admitting them. The voir dire was also necessary to determine whether or not cross-examination of the complainants was necessary to determine the credibility and trustworthiness of the statements, or to ensure trial fairness. </summary>
