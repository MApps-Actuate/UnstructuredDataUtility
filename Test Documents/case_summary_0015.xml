<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by corporation for declaration that solicitor was disentitled to fees and counterclaim by solicitor for payment of fees. The plaintiff, a corporation owned by a husband, wife and their children, owned three lots in Vancouver. In 2002, the family became interested in selling the property and in 2003 the defendant was retained to assist in completing a proposed sale. The scope of the retainer was not reduced to writing and the plaintiff said that no fee arrangement was ever entered into. The children stated that the essence of the oral retainer was that the solicitor was to obtain the best possible price for the property as quickly as possible and to structure the sale in a tax-friendly manner and that if the solicitor did not successfully complete the sale, he would not charge them. The property ultimately sold for $5,750,100. By the time of the closing, the husband and wife had died. The closing of the sale of the property was complicated by a number of issues including that the wills of the husband and wife had not been probated and that no one had signing authority for the plaintiff or its bank account. The solicitor prepared backdated assignments under which the husband and wife assigned all of their voting shares in the plaintiff to one of the children and had the two children who held powers of attorney for their parents sign the assignments as attorneys. Relying on those assignments, the voting shares were transferred to one of the children. After completion of the sale, the proceeds were placed in the solicitor's trust account and a dispute arose as to when the money would be distributed and the amount of the solicitor's fees. One of the children took the position that he had approved the solicitor's fees and authorized the removal of funds from the trust account. The other three children denied that approval or authorization was given and took the position that their sibling had no authority to give such authorization. A statement of account was not rendered until June 2006 which was backdated to February 2006. In September 2006, a supplementary account was issued. Three of the siblings asserted that they were unaware that the solicitor removed $926,916 from the trust account as fees and taxes until November, 2006 when the solicitor was cross-examined on his affidavits. The solicitor claimed that the plaintiff's shareholders agreed that his fees on a successful deal would be 25 to 30 per cent of the difference between the original offer and the actual sale price. The plaintiff brought a successful action against the solicitor for judgment in the amount of $926,916. In his defence in that action, the solicitor claimed that he had distributed the funds in accordance with the instructions of the plaintiff who had approved his account and counterclaimed that certain individuals had wrongfully prevented him from performing his obligations, intended to prevent performance of the fee agreement and that the action was an abuse of process. The solicitor was found to have improperly removed the sum from his trust account and judgment was awarded to the plaintiffs. In the application for special costs in relation to that trial, the solicitor and one of the children filed affidavits which contained numerous untruths designed to mislead the court and alleged that the solicitor's account had been approved, which caused the plaintiff to lose the special costs application. 	HELD: Application allowed and counterclaim dismissed. There was no interference by any of the plaintiff's shareholders in the solicitor's negotiations relating to the sale of the property. There was no concluded fee agreement for legal services between the parties and, in the normal course, the solicitor would have been entitled to a fair and reasonable fee on a quantum meruit basis. However, the conduct of the solicitor, in removing funds from his trust account without authorization, refusing to provide an account, ignoring requests regarding the whereabouts of the money, issuing his frivolous counterclaim, improperly backdating documents and fabricating evidence, disentitled him to any fee in relation to real estate and legal services. A reasonable fee for the solicitor's services would have been $150,000 plus taxes. </summary>
