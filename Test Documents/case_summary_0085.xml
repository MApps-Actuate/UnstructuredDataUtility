<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by the plaintiff strata owners to add a numbered company as a defendant. The plaintiffs sued for damages due to water infiltration in the condominium building. They alleged that the proposed defendant was the developer or general contractor for the project. 13 years passed from completion of the building to the commencement of these proceedings, and 17 years passed from completion to the present application. The plaintiffs argued s that it was still within the limitations period for its cause of action, and that addition of the proposed defendant was simply a matter of efficiency and avoiding duplicated proceedings. The proposed defendant argued the limitation period had expired. 	HELD: Application dismissed. With the plaintiffs' receipt in 1997 of the McArthur report at the very latest, the plaintiffs knew or should reasonably have known, that the problems with their building were not random or unconnected, and that there was a reasonable possibility that they were systemic and related to overall design and construction. There were ample indications of the proposed defendant's role long before the proceedings were commenced. The delay incurred in bringing the present application was significant and excessive and caused the proposed defendant prejudice in its ability to defend. </summary>
