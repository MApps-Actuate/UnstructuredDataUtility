<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by the plaintiff, Chalmers, for an order certifying her action against the defendants, AMO Canada and Advance Medical Optics, as a class proceeding. The infant plaintiff allegedly contracted a rare and serious eye infection from use of a contact lens solution manufactured and distributed by the defendants. The product was voluntarily recalled by the defendants. The plaintiff alleged that the defendants were negligent in researching, developing, testing, manufacturing, distributing, and selling the solution. She further claimed that the defendants engaged in deceptive acts or practices contrary to the Business Practices and Consumer Protection Act (BPCPA). Of the 13 pending class actions against the defendants, the plaintiff's was the first to proceed to a certification hearing. She proposed a class comprised of Canadian residents that purchased or used the solution and subsequently contracted or were tested for the infection, or those financially affected by the recall. Common issues were proposed in respect of negligence, punitive damages and the BPCPA claims. The defendants submitted that the statement of claim failed to disclose a cause of action under the BPCPA and did not support a claim for punitive damages. The defendants argued that the evidence was insufficient to establish that two or more persons fell within the class definition. The defendants argued that the class definition was overly broad. The defendants submitted that a class proceeding was not the preferable procedure for fair and efficient resolution of the issues, and that the plaintiff's litigation plan was unworkable. 	HELD: Application allowed. Although the plaintiff's pleadings were broadly stated, they were sufficiently detailed and particularized to permit the claims under the BPCPA to proceed. It was not plain and obvious that a claim for punitive damages could not succeed. There was sufficient evidence to certify the subclass of persons who contracted the infection after using the solution. Nothing precluded future certification of the remaining subclasses given sufficient evidence. The court had territorial competence over negligence claims by non-residents, as there was no basis to decline jurisdiction in favour of courts in other provinces. Individual issues did not dominate the common issues in a manner that vitiated a class action as the preferable manner in which to resolve the common issues. The plaintiff's litigation plan for the proceeding was workable. </summary>
