<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by the father against the respondent mother for an interim order that the residence of their child was not to be moved from Ottawa. The parties married in August 1997. Their son was born on December 9, 1999. The parties separated on October 28, 2001. The mother had been the primary caregiver of the child since the separation. There was no agreement or order regarding custody. The father had access every second day and overnight every second weekend. The mother wanted to move to Toronto to resume her modelling career. She claimed the move was necessary because she lost her employment in Ottawa. 	HELD: Application allowed. The child was to remain in Ottawa. If the mother decided to move, the child would remain in the interim care of the father. The father had significant and consistent access with the child. It was in the child's best interests to have maximum contact with both parents. The move would affect the child's access with the father and the mother's extended family who lived in Ottawa. It was not clear whether the mother's employment was terminated or she resigned. There was no evidence that the mother sought to pursue other employment opportunities in Ottawa. There was also no evidence about the mother's potential earnings as a model. Her plans were not certain or economically sound. It was not in the child's best interests to move to Toronto. </summary>
