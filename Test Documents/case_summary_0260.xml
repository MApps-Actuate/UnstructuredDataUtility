<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Sentencing of Chau on charges of cultivating marijuana. Chau had pleaded guilty to the offence. Peel police executed a search warrant at a residence leased by Chau, and found a hydroponic marijuana growing operation. The Crown sought a sentence of 12 months imprisonment, while Chau sought a conditional sentence. The plants found had a value of $731,360. Further, the operation involved the illegal bypassing of hydro cables and theft of electricity. Chau, 32, was a landed immigrant from Vietnam. He was unemployed at the time of the offence. He had an otherwise good work record, and was currently employed as a waiter. His probation officer claimed that he had expressed regret for his actions, and had accepted responsibility for them. 	HELD: A conditional sentence of 15 months was imposed. A conditional sentence would not endanger the community. The mitigating factors included Chau's co-operation with the police and guilty plea, and the fact that this was a first offence. Chau was also ordered to pay restitution and perform 100 hours of community service. </summary>
