<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Action by plaintiff for damages for injuries arising out of motor vehicle accident. The plaintiff was injured when the vehicle he was driving past an entrance to a shopping centre was hit by a car coming out of the shopping centre entrance. Liability for the accident was admitted and the only issue was the assessment of damages. Immediately following the accident, the plaintiff felt dizzy and approximately one to two hours after the accident he felt stiffness in his neck and pain in his arm. The plaintiff saw his doctor on the day of the accident and she diagnosed a soft tissue injury to his neck and a left shoulder sprain and referred the plaintiff to physiotherapy. In future visits to his doctor, the plaintiff continued to complain of left shoulder problems and the doctor was of the view that the plaintiff had developed rotator cuff syndrome of the left shoulder. The plaintiff was sent to see an orthopaedic specialist who diagnosed a partial tear of the rotator cuff. Approximately two weeks after the accident, the plaintiff's neck injury was almost completely healed. The plaintiff claimed that he continued to suffer from swelling, seizing, pain and spasms in the shoulder and could not work for extended periods of time. At the time of the accident, the plaintiff was 42 years of age and was a Chinese food restaurant cook. He contended that the accident resulted in a permanent injury to his left shoulder which limited his ability to work as a Chinese restaurant cook, prevented further upwards mobility in that field and resulted in pain and suffering, a loss of wages, loss of future earning capacity and costs of future care. 	HELD: Action allowed. The plaintiff was awarded damages for past income loss in the amount of $10,000, future loss of earnings and loss of earning capacity in the amount of $21,000, special damages of $1,685 and non-pecuniary damages in the amount of $22,000. The plaintiff injured his left shoulder in the motor vehicle accident and continued to suffer shoulder difficulties initially caused by the accident. The shoulder injury affected the plaintiff's ability to work and the plaintiff had suffered a loss of income of about $3,000 per year from the date of the accident. Given the plaintiff's low historical earnings, $6,000 was adequate compensation for any future loss of earnings caused by the possible necessity of treatment in the future. In addition, the plaintiff was entitled to an addition award of $15,000 for loss of earning capacity to compensate for the possibility that his ongoing shoulder problems would impair his future earnings. </summary>
