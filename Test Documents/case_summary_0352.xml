<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Motion by Garofalo for an order noting All Type and Papadopoulos in default. All Type and Papadopoulos moved for an order dismissing the action, which was commenced in 1990. All Type, a mortgage broker for which Papadopoulos acted as principal was dissolved in 1994. Garofalo claimed he retained Papadopoulos, based on his expertise and knowledge, to invest $16,000 in a second mortgage. Papadopoulos made several misrepresentations about the investment, including the fact he invested only $15,000 in a third mortgage, and either refused or neglected to take proceedings to enforce it when the mortgagor defaulted on her obligations. As a result, Garofalo lost his entire investment. He claimed All Type and Papadopoulos breached their fiduciary duties, knowing he was then an unsophisticated investor. He sought the return of his investment, general and punitive damages. Papadopoulos made an assignment in bankruptcy in 1991 but did not disclose the existence of Garofalo's claim. Garofalo's lawyers were informed of the assignment but receive no other notification of it and their insolvency search did not confirm the assignment. Papadopoulos was discharged from bankruptcy in 1993 but Garofalo was not informed of the discharge until 2004. Garofalo made several previous unsuccessful attempts to have the defendants noted in default. He provided evidence of a letter written by the defendant's lawyers in 1990, acknowledging service of his statement of claim. 	HELD: Motion by Garofalo allowed and motion by All Type and Papadopoulos dismissed. Garofalo was granted judgment for $16,000 plus interest at 16 percent until the mortgage maturity date, and pre-- and post-judgment interest thereafter. The letter from the defendants' lawyer acknowledging service of the statement of claim was adequate to show it had been served. Garofalo's allegations, if proven, gave rise to Papadopoulos's liability for defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity. The claim was not affected by Papadopoulos's discharge from bankruptcy. By disregarding Garofalo's instructions and investing his money in a more hazardous investment, the defendants breached their fiduciary obligations to serve ad protect Garofalo's interests. The relationship existed between Garofalo and Papadopoulos personally, not simply as an employee of All Type. The extreme delay could not be blamed on Garofalo, who was waiting to hear from Papadopoulos's trustee and did not know how long bankruptcy proceedings should take. The delay was caused by Papadopoulos's failure to list Garofalo as a creditor at the time of his assignment. </summary>
