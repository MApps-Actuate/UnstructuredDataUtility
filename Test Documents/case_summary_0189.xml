<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>In this action, the plaintiff bank sought the balance allegedly due on a loan granted to the defendant -- The defendant's principal argument was that the bank had failed to obtain a reasonable net return on the sale of his mini home, the collateral security applied against the balance outstanding on the loan -- The home was appraised at being worth $17,500 and sold for $18,500 -- The provincial tax notices, however, had assessed its value at $35,500 in 2006, the year in which it was sold -- HELD: The plaintiff bank was awarded judgment for $31,665 -- There was no basis for a defence based on failure to properly account for the balance owing -- The court was satisfied on reading the appraiser's report that the appraiser's opinion as to the market value of the mini home ought to be accepted as a fair estimate of the net market value of the property -- Although the difference between the assessed value and the appraised value was considerable, and the defendant was in no financial position to provide expert appraisal to support his position, the best evidence before the court was the appraiser's report and the oral testimony advanced in support of his opinion. </summary>
