<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>The plaintiff sought damages for the cost of medical/ rehabilitation treatments he received following a 2002 motor vehicle accident which occurred in the course of his employment -- The defendant insurer denied liability arguing he was not entitled to receive accident benefits under the Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule after November, 1996 -- The issues were whether this was in fact the case, and whether the defendant was liable based upon an action in negligence for having allegedly given the plaintiff incorrect legal advice -- The evidence was that $9,057 for treatment services remained unpaid and owing to the agent of record for the plaintiff as a result of the rates of compensation paid by the WSIB -- HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed -- The plaintiff was not entitled to benefits under the SABS -- Section 59(1) clearly stated that an insurer was not required to pay benefits in respect of any person entitled to receive benefits under any workers' compensation law or plan -- There was no evidence that there was a dispute with respect to the applicability of that section, or suggesting that the WSIB at any time denied or disputed coverage for the medical benefits sought by the plaintiff -- The fact that the plaintiff incorrectly believed a lawsuit against the other driver was available and pursued such did not constitute a dispute under s. 59(5) -- It was the clear intention under the SABS that the insurer, as a provider of benefits, was the last resort -- There was no evidence of negligence on the part of the insurer -- The letter from the insurer had not purported to advise the plaintiff as to the definite availability of any legal action -- There was no order made as to costs as there was an issue for trial on statutory interpretation. </summary>
