<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by the Association of Justices of the Peace of Ontario and three former justices of the peace for a declaration that legislative provisions mandating their retirement at the age of 70 years were unconstitutional. The former justices each retired at or around the age of 70, despite the fact they all indicated that they wished to continue as justices. Each contributed significantly to the work of the court during their careers, demonstrating a strong commitment to the justice systems and a desire and ability to continue to make a useful contribution past age 70. Each gave evidence of the loss of dignity and respect and losses of income they experienced when they were forced to retire. Justices of the peace had many duties in Ontario. Until 1984, they received their appointments for life. In 1989, the mandatory retirement age was set at 70 years, based on a report commissioned by the Attorney General from a law professor. At a 2000 review, the Association and the Chief Justice of the Ontario Court of Justice recommended permitting justices to retire at 65 or to continue in office until 75, subject to annual review by the Chief Justice. These changes were not implemented. In 2005, Ontario enacted a statute making mandatory retirement provisions illegal for most employers, but it did not apply to justices of the peace. The parties agreed that mandatory retirement of judicial officers was necessary to reinforce their security of tenure. Ontario provincial court judges, who worked closely with justices of the peace, were permitted to serve until they were 75. 	HELD: Application allowed. The mandatory retirement of justices of the peace violated their rights under s. 15 of the Charter and the limit was not justified, as the evidence indicated that the legislative objective could be accomplished in a significantly less intrusive manner. In addition, the harmful effects of the provisions were not proportional to the legislative goal of judicial independence. The violation was remedied by reading in the retirement provisions applicable to provincial court judges, providing for retirement at age 65 or to continue in office until the age of 75, subject to the annual approval of the Chief Justice of the Ontario Court of Justice. There was no evidence, other than the 1989 report, supporting the age of 70 as the correct retirement age for justices of the peace. The report's recommendation was accepted without discussion or analysis, prior to the enactment of legislation prohibiting mandatory retirement provisions in legislation in Ontario. There was no evidence that the legislature revisited the mandatory retirement age for justices of the peace anytime subsequently. The concerns of the individual justices were not overly sensitive or unreasonable. Forcing them to stop working based on age affected their dignity, and had profound psychological, social and financial impacts. The fact they were the only group in Ontario forced to retire at age 70 demonstrated the discriminatory nature and effect of the provisions. However, it was not an appropriate case for an award of damages because there is no evidence of misconduct such as bad faith, abuse of power, negligence or willful blindness in respect of constitutional obligations. </summary>
