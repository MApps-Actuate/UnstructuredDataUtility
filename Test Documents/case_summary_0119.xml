<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Motion by the defendant for an extension of time to file a motion for leave to appeal an interlocutory decision or, if it was found that the decision he wished to appeal was not interlocutory in nature, he sought an extension of time to file a notice of appeal. The decision he sought to appeal was one in which a judge of the Court of Queen's Bench dismissed the applicant's motion to set aside a default judgment. The respondents, practicing under the name Cabel Peters, had commenced an action against the applicant claiming the sum of $14,426. On February 4, 2007, the applicant was served with the originating process. On February 21, 2007, the applicant filed a Notice of Intent to Defend but did not serve it on the respondents. On March 1, 2007, the respondents had the applicant noted in default and obtained default judgment. A motion judge set aside the default judgment and ordered that a statement of defence be filed "within a period of ten days of June 22nd, 2007." That ten-day period expired and the applicant failed to file a statement of defence or have any contact with the respondents. 	HELD: Motion dismissed. Appeal dismissed. The decision that the applicant sought to appeal was not interlocutory in nature. Leave to appeal was not required. While the court was satisfied that the applicant intended to appeal within the prescribed time, the motion judge applied the correct criteria in determining whether the second default judgment should be set aside in the interests of justice. The appeal would be frivolous. </summary>
