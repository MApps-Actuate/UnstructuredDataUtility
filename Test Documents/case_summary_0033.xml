<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Assessment of damages following Wendel's successful action against Tristar for damages for breach of a stock option agreement. Wendel exercised his option on March 20, 2008. Tristar notified him it would not issue the shares on March 26. Wendel launched his action for specific performance on April 3, 2008. he amended his claim on May 28, 2008, seeking damages rather than specific performance. The parties agreed the stock option agreement did not provide a closing date, and agreed a reasonable date for closing would be April 11, 2008. Wendel took the position his damages should be assessed at the closing date. Tristar argued Wendel kept the option agreement alive by initially claiming specific performance, and that damages should be assessed at the date Wendel elected to claim damages instead. 	HELD: Damages were to be assessed at the date of Wendel's election, May 28, 2008. There was no evidence the value of the shares at issue declined since the date of the breach. Having made his election after commencing the action and before trial, it was fair and reasonable that damages be assessed at the time of the election. </summary>
