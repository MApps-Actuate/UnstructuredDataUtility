<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Action for damages for wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff was employed by the defendant as a salesperson/interior designer in 1981. She was promoted to the position of store manager in October 1985, a position she occupied until her employment was terminated in January 1989. As manager, her duties included supervision and training of the staff, approval of interior design layouts, conducting weekly sales meetings and general problem solving. In March 1987, two employees working in the store managed by the plaintiff left the defendant's employment over their disagreement with the way their vacation pay was being calculated by the defendant's accounting office. The plaintiff was, thereafter, consistently blamed for the departure of the employees on the ground that she failed to adequately explain the defendant's policies and philosophy to the employees. After two negative performance reviews in 1988, the plaintiff was in November of that year offered an entirely new job, that of a team designer. This was essentially a salesperson position entirely lacking in managerial duties. While the plaintiff's position as manager brought in annual income of $47,000 plus a quantity bonus, the salary attached to the new position was $42,000 plus bonuses. Both the salary bonus were payable at the offered level if the plaintiff met a sales target of $750,000. Having given up all her clientele when she became manager in 1985, the plaintiff considered the said target impossible to meet. After her termination, the plaintiff made several attempts to obtain a comparable position and when they failed, she started her own interior design business in November, 1989. 	HELD: Action allowed. In the face of the substantial difference between the salary offered to the plaintiff and that which she was receiving at the material time, the clear element of demotion in requiring her to work as an equal with those who had reported to her and the deterioration in her personal relationship with the defendant's top management, it would not have been reasonable to require the plaintiff to remain in the defendant's employment in the offered position even for a short term as a mitigation of her damages. In this case, 12 months was an appropriate notice period considering managerial nature of the plaintiff's position, the length of service and the difficulties actually experienced in locating equivalent employment. The plaintiff was entitled to all the benefits and bonuses associated with the notice period. </summary>
