<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by the committed person, O'Brien, for appointment of counsel to represent him in respect of his appeal from an extradition order. An extradition judge ordered the applicant committed with respect to charges pending in the United States related to conspiracy to traffic marijuana, conspiracy to possess marijuana for the purpose of trafficking, and conspiracy to import ephedrine. Identity of the perpetrator was the only issue at the extradition hearing. In ordering committal, the judge relied on unsourced identification information from the record of the case, and on certain features detected from a photograph that did not outright identify the accused in and of itself. The applicant appealed the order on the day it was granted and was granted judicial interim release. The applicant submitted that the judge erred in his assessment of the identification evidence, and erred in finding that the unsourced information was admissible. The Minister issued a surrender order, but no enforcement steps had been taken. The applicant sought the appointment of state-funded counsel on the basis of his financial circumstances and the refusal of representation by legal aid. 	HELD: Application allowed on limited basis. The applicant did not meet the criteria for appointment of counsel to represent him on his appeal. The affidavit material regarding the applicant's financial circumstances was insufficient, but nonetheless supported a finding that he was unable to afford the full services of counsel. The core issues on appeal were narrow and not complex. Based on recently-decided jurisprudence, it was unlikely that the extradition order would be overturned. With the benefit of basic legal advice, the applicant was capable of presenting his position on appeal. In the interests of justice, counsel was appointed on the limited basis of advising the applicant on the issues of whether to continue with his appeal of the committal order, whether to seek judicial review of the surrender order, and whether to seek further judicial interim release. </summary>
