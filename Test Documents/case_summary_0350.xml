<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Appeal by the defendant Greve from the order granting the plaintiffs' motion to strike Greve's jury notice at the commencement of trial. The action arose out of a motor vehicle accident and the plaintiff Kayhan alleged that she had sustained serious and permanent personal injuries as a result of the accident. Greve served a jury notice with her statement of defence. At the commencement of the trial, Kayhan moved to strike the jury notice and to have the matter tried by a judge alone. Kayhan brought the motion on the basis that she, as a Muslim-Canadian woman of Afghan descent, would not receive a fair trial due to the current political climate and the existence of racism in Canadian society. The trial judge struck the jury notice on the basis that there was a strong risk and a reasonable apprehension that there would be bias on the part of the jury. Leave to appeal was granted on the basis that there was reason to doubt the correctness of the decision and because the matter involved issues of general importance. At the appeal, Greve took the position that trial by jury was a substantive right that should not be taken away except for cogent reasons. While the respondents agreed that trial by jury was a substantive right, they submitted that the right was not absolute. 	HELD: Appeal allowed. The trial judge erred in his reliance on judicial notice to support his decision that there was a strong risk of bias on the part of the jury. There was no link established between the existence of a lack of impartiality and the inability of potential jurors to set aside such biases. To conclude that potential jurors would be impossibly tainted without any supporting evidence would be to improperly exercise judicial discretion. Therefore, the trial judge made a palpable and overriding error. </summary>
