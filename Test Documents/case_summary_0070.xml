<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by Kucy for an order striking Johar's writ of summons and statement of claim for disclosing no cause of action. Johar's claims of abuse of process and malicious prosecution against Kucy related to complaints Kucy made to the B.C. Veterinarian Medical Association against Johar, a veterinarian, while Kucy was working for Johar. Johar alleged Kucy's complaint was untrue, unfounded, motivated by malice and aimed at causing Johar personal, professional, emotional and financial damage. 	HELD: Application allowed. Because Kucy's complaints were made to a quasi-judicial body, they were absolutely privileged and could not support Johar's claims of abuse or process and malicious prosecution. </summary>
