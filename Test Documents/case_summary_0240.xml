<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Motion by the plaintiff Robb to vary or revoke rulings regarding the admission of evidence during a trial. Robb had intended to prove the documents through witnesses he anticipated the defendant the Red Cross would call. When the Red Cross opened its case, Robb realized that the witnesses he needed would not be called. Before Robb closed his case, a list of all exhibits was prepared showing whether or not each exhibit was the subject matter of a ruling by the court. Robb was invited to agree or disagree on the status of the list. He refused to participate in the process and closed his case. When the Red Cross was asked in court which witnesses it intended to call, it responded that it had to wait until Robb closed his case. Robb argued that the circumstances in existence at the time the order denying the documents' admissibility was made had now materially changed. 	HELD: Motion dismissed. Robb failed to prove that there was a material change. Both sides had made tactical decisions. It was inappropriate to re-visit these decisions by revoking rulings and permitting Robb to re-open his case. It was obvious that the Red Cross was attempting, by the use of the list, to determine what evidence was in against it. The Red Cross never suggested to Robb that it would be calling the witnesses Robb wanted. The Red Cross was entitled to know the case it had to meet. There was a potential for great prejudice to the Red Cross and other defendants if rulings were revoked or varied in these circumstances. </summary>
