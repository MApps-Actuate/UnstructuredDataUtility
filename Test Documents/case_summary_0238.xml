<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Appeal by the applicants from a decision of the motions judge finding that the shareholder loans were repayable on demand and that the general security agreement constituted a valid and enforceable obligation of the corporation in favour of the respondents. The parties had entered into a unanimous shareholders' agreement which provided that the advances of money made by the respondents were for an indefinite period. The motions judge rejected the appellants' contention that the loans were not to be repaid until commencement of the operations under the parties' venture. 	HELD: Appeal allowed in part. The motions judge was correct in finding that the loans were not repayable until commencement of the operations under the venture. Such condition was not included in the contract. Even if he loans were not repayable on demand, they were repayable after expiration of a reasonable time and that time had passed in this case. The security agreement was provided for under the shareholders' agreement and it was thus enforceable. The promissory notes, however, were not provided for under the agreement and should have been declared null and void. </summary>
