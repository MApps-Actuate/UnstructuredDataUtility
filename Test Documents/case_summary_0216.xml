<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>This was an appeal from an order of the Master allowing the addition of fourth parties. In the main action, B sued the defendants for damages arising out of alleged deficiencies in an office tower and parking garage built by the defendants, The defendants added the City of Ottawa as a third party, claiming contribution and indemnity. The defendants argued that salt spread by the city near the office tower was carried into the parking garage by cars, and this caused the deterioration of the garage. The deteriorating conditions had occurred in 1977, 1978 and 1979. The action had been commenced in 1984. Pleadings and examination for discovery were completed, and trial date was fixed for September 1988. The fourth party order was issued in March 1988. It added other municipal governments surrounding Ottawa, on the ground that they too had spread salt which would have been carried into the parking garage. 	HELD: The appeal was allowed. The Master had considered the prejudice resulting from extending the trial date, the difficulties with the pleadings, the length of examinations and the amount of documents produced. He balanced these against the need to prevent multiple proceedings. These were proper considerations, but he erred when he held that the plaintiff should show that its case would be strongly affected before prejudice could be shown. In view of this error, the Court considered all the evidence as an original application. The fourth party application could have been made when the third parties were added. There was no adequate excuse for the delay. The plaintiff would be prejudiced by the delay in trial and by the increased lapse of time from 1977 when the first observations of deterioration were made. The Master's order was set aside. </summary>
