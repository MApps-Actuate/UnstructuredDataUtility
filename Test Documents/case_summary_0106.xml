<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Appeal by the husband from an order in family proceedings, awarding the wife sole custody of the parties' children, child support and nominal spousal support, setting aside a marriage agreement and awarding the wife an unequal share of the family assets. The parties married in Iran and had three children. The wife did not work and the husband supported the family on his income of between $29,000 and $40,000. He claimed he had been unable to work after the parties separated but provided no evidence to explain why. He was imputed with income of $24,000 for support purposes and ordered to pay child support of $504 per month. He had been awarded access to the children on alternate weekends but was not always exercising it. He argued the wife was not entitled to a share of the family assets including $86,948 in sale proceeds from the family home and the balances in the husband's accounts, but the judge awarded the wife the sale proceeds because of her contribution as the primary caregiver for the children and primary homemaker during the marriage. The unequal property division also meant the husband's support arrears of $9,892 would be cancelled. 	HELD: Appeal dismissed. There was no reason to interfere with the apportionment of family assets or the other aspects of the order. The parties ended up with a roughly equal share of the family assets. The child support order was modest at best. The custody and access order was appropriate. The marriage agreement did not operate fairly under B.C. law, so it was appropriate to set it aside. </summary>
