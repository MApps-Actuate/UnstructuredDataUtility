<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Appeal by the accused, Lees, from conviction for conspiring to import cocaine into Canada. The accused and five others were arrested in connection with the conspiracy. The investigation involved an alleged co-conspirator who became a police informant, and the interception of one side of various telephone conversations. Twelve kilograms of cocaine were delivered to a resort island in the United States, where four men were arrested and subsequently convicted. The accused and another individual were arrested and tried in Canada. The other individual was acquitted. The accused was convicted. At trial, he contended that he was involved in a conspiracy to import American currency, or ecstasy, but not cocaine. The accused's appeal related to an intercepted conversation characterized as the facilitating telephone call the night prior to the cocaine delivery. The conversation was between the American that became a police informant and an unknown speaker. The informant testified that the speaker was the accused. The trial judge found instead that the unknown speaker was one of the American conspirators. However, the judge found that, on all of the evidence, the accused had been in telephone contact with that conspirator in advance of the delivery of the cocaine. The judge found that there was no other conclusion than that the accused had communicated with that American conspirator to assist in the cocaine's delivery for importation into Canada. On appeal, the accused submitted that the judge erred in admitting the American conspirator's hearsay statement made in the facilitating telephone call as evidence that the accused was involved in the conspiracy. The accused further submitted that the judge erred in failing to consider and resolve contradictory evidence in relation to the facilitating telephone call. The accused argued that without the evidence of the facilitating telephone call, the conviction was unreasonable and unsupported by the evidence. 	HELD: Appeal dismissed. The statements made in the facilitating telephone call were not admitted for the truth of their contents and thus were not hearsay. Therefore, it was not necessary to rely on the co-conspirators' exception to the hearsay rule or any other exception for the admission of the contents of the call. Nor was it necessary to consider and either adopt or reject other possible versions of events that were simply not supported by the evidence. The statements had circumstantial rather than testimonial value. The existence of the statements rather than their veracity was material. Since the facilitating call was properly admissible against the accused, it could not be said that the trial judge's verdict was unreasonable. </summary>
