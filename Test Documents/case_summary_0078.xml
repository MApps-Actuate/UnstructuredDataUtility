<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Appeal by the City of Colwood from a declaration that bylaws passed by the City as a preliminary step to changing the mode of taxation contravened s. 211(2) of the Community Charter. Under the Municipal Act and the Community Charter, local government could finance and construct services upon being satisfied, through a petition process, that there was the requisite support for the project and that the beneficiaries of the construction were prepared to shoulder all or part of the costs. Andrex Developments submitted such a petition to obtain sewer services. The City then changed the method of cost recovery for a sanitary sewer trunk main. The original bylaw provided for a charge on the assessed value of land only for 15 years. The new bylaws provided for a parcel tax, to which Andrex had not consented. The application judge held that the new bylaws were illegal, as the City had no authority to impose a parcel tax without amending the original bylaw. 	HELD: Appeal allowed and matter remitted to trial court for redetermination. Fresh assent was not required before the City could proceed to levy a parcel tax, and the bylaw permitted parcel tax recovery of the construction costs. Andrex's petition was required to set out either a parcel tax calculation or the proportion of the cost of the work that would be recovered. The petition satisfied that requirement by setting out the percentage of construction costs that would be paid by the petitioner over 15 years. Section 646(4) of the Municipal Act empowered the Council to levy or impose a charge to recoup construction costs as a property value tax, a parcel tax, or fees. By referring to s. 646(4), and not limiting a levy to a property value tax, the petition left open to the City discretion as to the form the tax would take, to be determined when Council exercised the City's taxing power. There was nothing in the language of the petition which detracted from the plain meaning that Andrex assented to all modes of cost recovery contemplated by s. 646(4). It was best to remit the issue of the content of the bylaws and their compliance with the provisions of the Community Charter relating to creation of a parcel tax roll to the trial court. </summary>
