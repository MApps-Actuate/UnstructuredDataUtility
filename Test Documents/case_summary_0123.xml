<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Motion by CEG for leave to appeal a decision dismissing CEG's motion to have "independent" legal counsel represent the children of the marriage. CEG and PEC were married in 1993 and divorced in 2003. There were two children of the marriage. PEC brought a motion pursuant to the Divorce Act for a variation of custody and access. At the commencement of the hearing, CEG brought a motion to have "independent" legal counsel represent the children. CEG was able to identify that "independent" counsel, and CEG informed the motion judge that she would be paying for the "independent" counsel. In dismissing the motion that the children be represented by their own counsel the motion judge opined that the appointment would unduly delay matters and result in inconvenience. The motion judge also expressed concern about the fact that one of the parties to the litigation would be paying the children's legal fees in the event that counsel for the children were to participate at the hearing. 	HELD: Motion for leave to appeal dismissed. None of the preconditions for leave to appeal were met in this case. CEG failed to bring to the Court's attention any conflicting decisions on the question involved in the proposed appeal. Further, the Court did not doubt the correctness of the motion judge's decision. The refusal to permit counsel for non-parties to participate in the trial process was a discretionary decision. It could not be said that the motion judge erred in her application of the law, seriously misapprehended the evidence, or was manifestly wrong. The appellant's argument that the children's ss. 7 and 15 Charter rights had been violated was without merit. The Charter was designed to limit the potential intrusion of government into the daily lives of individuals. It was not designed to govern matters between private litigants. A judge's failure to grant an order did not constitute governmental action. </summary>
