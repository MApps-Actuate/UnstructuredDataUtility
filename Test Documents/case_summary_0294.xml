<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Motion by the plaintiff, Look Communications, for an interlocutory injunction restraining the defendant, Bell Canada, from terminating telecommunication services provided to Look pending final determination of its action -- Look provided broadcasting and internet services to customers -- Bell was a former shareholder of Look that was involved in the design of the network by which Look provided its services -- In order to provide its services to its customers, Look was highly dependent upon Bell's provision of complex telecommunications services and infrastructure pursuant to a variety of arrangements and agreements -- A dispute arose over the amounts owed by Look for the provision of services by Bell -- Look contended that it owed nothing by virtue of an agreement whereby Bell promised significant savings if Look utilized Bell as its exclusive supplier -- Look contended that Bell owed it approximately $8 million -- Bell continued to supply services without payment from Look -- It asserted that Look was in default of its payment obligations in excess of $13 million -- Look brought the within action and motion in response to Bell's service of a formal notice of intent to disconnect its services -- HELD: Motion allowed -- The injunctive relief sought by Look was prohibitory in nature rather than mandatory -- The relief sought required Bell to perform obligations under existing agreements and included a term that Look would provide ongoing payment without prejudice to claim overpayment upon adjudication of the dispute -- The action was neither frivolous, nor vexatious -- If Bell disconnected services, Look was unable to secure replacement services for considerable time, and at considerable expense -- The result would be a substantial loss of its customer base, thus causing irreparable harm -- The balance of convenience favoured Look given its undertaking to make regular payments, and the potential disruption of its business -- Look had sufficient assets to meet its undertaking as to damages. </summary>
