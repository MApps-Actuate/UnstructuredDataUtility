<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>This was an appeal by a woodcutter from a judgment awarding him $402,074.62 in damages for negligence and battery from a back operation performed by the defendant as well as solicitor and client costs. The respondent had admitted he had erroneously operated at the L4-L5 level to correct a disc protrusion. The appellant argued the judge erred in not also finding there was a breach of contract because the respondent had guaranteed the success of the surgery. The appellant also asserted that the trial judge had erred in his assessment of damages for future loss of income and in not awarding punitive damages. The appellant had been awarded $174,591 for future loss of income. This had been based on comparing pre and post-accident potential earnings and awarding the difference. It was argued he had accepted evidence concerning the effect of seniority, erred in not assuming work to age 55, overestimated the appellant's earning potential, and applied contingencies unevenly. The defendant had done a follow- up myelogram after the operation and the trial judge had found he must have become aware then that he had operated at the same level. He then altered the hospital records respecting the preoperative diagnosis pertaining to the first operation and obtained the appellant's consent to perform a second operation without telling him he had made a mistake and operated at the wrong level the first time. The judge had found this denied the appellant a proper second opinion. 	HELD: The appeal was allowed in part. There was no guarantee of success and no breach of contract. This ground was dismissed. The judge should have assumed work to age 55. He had also erred in assuming the appellant could have been retrained and earned $35,000 at the mill. He ignored evidence suggesting the appellant's educational potential was only to a level below that at which new hirees were sought. The reasonable figure was a capacity to earn $20,000. The judge also erred in not considering the claim for loss of employee benefits. There had been an uneven application of contingencies. Negative contingencies outweighed positive contingencies and amounted to 20 per cent. The award for future loss of earning capacity was increased to $344,920. The alteration of the notes was more than mere negligence. It alone justified an award of punitive damages. The deliberate non-disclosure was a misrepresentation by omission. The consent to the second operation was not a true consent and there was a second battery and a breach of fiduciary duty. The defendant's conduct was morally offensive, cold, calculating, arrogant and callous. The appellant was awarded $40,000 in punitive damages. The award of solicitor and client costs was upheld. The judge had found the defendant's conduct had caused the appellant considerable difficulty in prosecuting his action. Solicitor and client costs of the appeal were awarded as well. </summary>
