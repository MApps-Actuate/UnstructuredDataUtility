<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Motion by a father to vary a custody order giving him interim sole custody, or to re-establish joint custody in Sudbury. The children were ten and six. The parties lived in Hamilton during the marriage, and when they separated, the mother moved with the children to Sudbury. The father left his job and moved to Sudbury to be near the children. The parties consented to an order granting them joint custody, with primary guardianship to the mother. The mother met a man in Oshawa, five hours away by car, and obtained a job there. Without notice to the father, she moved the children to Oshawa, notifying him later by letter and offering expanded access. 	HELD: Motion allowed. The mother was to retain primary custody but on the condition that she return the children to Sudbury. It was in the children's best interests that they reside in Sudbury. Although the relocation was complete, this was to be accorded little weight, given that the mother accomplished it without notice or consent. It was a material change of circumstances permitting court intervention, and it was important that the children have maximum contact with each parent. They were doing well in school in Sudbury and they had extended family there. If the mother was unwilling or unable to return to Sudbury, the father was to have an interim order varying custody such that the children's primary residence was to be with him. </summary>
