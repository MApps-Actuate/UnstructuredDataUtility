<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by plaintiff Coss Systems inc. (Coss) to extend an order restraining the defendants from realizing on property seized from the plaintiff. Defendant Peter Spitzer entered into an employment agreement with Coss which contained a provision restricting his use of confidential information. Coss owed a substantial debt to RBC. Genius Solutions Ltd. (Genius) paid off RBC and took an assignment of its security, which it then used to seize computers and telephones from Coss. Spitzer incorporated Genius, and was a Director and, at least indirectly, an owner thereof. The president of Genius was Spitzer's step-father, Heinz Harre. Harre testified that Genius paid of the RBC debt for the specific purpose of acquiring from the computer system the customer base, employee information and intellectual property of Coss. 	HELD: Application allowed. There was a real danger that a substantial prejudice to Coss would arise if Spitzer was allowed to have access to confidential information on the seized computers, either directly or indirectly. The order was extended to the final disposition of the issues or until further order of the Court. </summary>
