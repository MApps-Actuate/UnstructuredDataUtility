<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by Collins for an order cancelling a certificate of pending litigation registered by Westcoast against Collins' property. Westcoast alleged an oral joint venture agreement between the parties entitled it to a one-half interest in the property, and claimed Collins was unjustly enriched by the services Westcoast provided under the agreement. After registering a certificate of pending litigation against the property, Westcoast took no steps to pursue its claims for more than one year, but both parties subsequently became actively engaged in moving the matter forward. 	HELD: Application dismissed. Although Westcoast's claim to a trust over the property was tenuous, the certificate was not cancelled. The application might have succeeded during the period of dormancy, but cancellation of the certificate was not appropriate after the matter had started moving forward again. There was no evidence Collins would suffer hardship or inconvenience if the certificate was not cancelled. </summary>
