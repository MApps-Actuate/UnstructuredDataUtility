<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by the accused, Black, for leave to cross-examine police constables Fortin and Vachon -- Following extensive investigation, the accused and his mother were among several charged with offences related to laundering proceeds from marijuana cultivation -- Vachon was the affiant in affidavits filed in support of four applications to intercept private communications -- Fortin was the affiant in affidavits filed in support of an application for a special search warrant -- The accused sought to cross-examine them in the context of a motion on behalf of himself, and his various companies, to quash several warrants, authorizations, production orders and assistance orders based on violations of his rights protected by ss. 7, 8, 9 and 10 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms -- The accused submitted that cross-examination of Vachon would discredit the existence of the prerequisite of investigative necessity and the reliability of the confidential sources -- The accused further submitted that cross-examination would clarify misleading or incomplete disclosure and inadequate drafting -- The accused submitted that Fortin did not disclose the existence of a search warrant issued prior to the issuance of the special search warrant in breach of s. 462.32(2) of the Criminal Code -- The Crown submitted that there was an insufficient evidentiary foundation to permit leave to cross-examine -- HELD: Application dismissed -- The accused failed to demonstrate existence of a reasonable possibility that cross-examination of Vachon could elicit evidence that could undermine the issuance of the authorizations -- Informer reliability was sufficiently addressed in the affidavit -- There was no evidence that Vachon used inadequate drafting language in an effort to trick or induce the issuing judge in error -- The affidavit sufficiently discussed the use of non wiretap investigative procedures, and why they were not likely to have succeeded -- No useful purpose would be achieved by granting leave to cross-examine Fortin, as Fortin had admitted that the omission of a statement regarding issuance of a previous warrant was through inadvertence. </summary>
