<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by Mulder for judicial review of a decision by the minister of health not to pay for medical services provided in the US -- The applicant, a lifelong resident of New Brunswick, was diagnosed with chronic myelogenous leukemia in 2000 -- Following a bone marrow transplant in 2000, the applicant developed chronic graft-versus-host disease involving his eyes, liver and skin -- After attempts to treat the condition by regional doctors were unsuccessful, the applicant sought treatment at the John Hopkins Oncology Centre in Baltimore, Maryland in 2003 -- Further complications led to extensive treatment at Bringham and Women's Hospital in Boston over the next several years -- The minister claimed that the applicant did not receive pre-approval for the treatments in Boston and that the applicant could have received treatment in Saskatchewan -- The minister claimed that the treatment at Johns Hopkins was not required, as the applicant's condition was urgent, but not an emergency -- The applicant claimed that delays and waiting periods in Saskatchewan were prohibitive -- The applicant claimed that the minister lost or exceeded his jurisdiction by failing to exercise his discretion to pay for the treatment and that he had been denied procedural fairness because he was not permitted to make oral submissions at the hearing of the matter -- HELD: Application dismissed -- The treatments received in the US did not constitute entitled services under the Medical Services Payment Act and Regulations -- The services provided were not provided on an emergency basis and treatment could have been obtained in Canada -- Accordingly, the minister's decision was not in error and the minister had not exceeded or lost jurisdiction by failing to exercise his discretion to reimburse the applicant for the treatment -- The applicant had not been denied his right to procedural fairness; there was no requirement that he be allowed to make oral submissions at the hearing. </summary>
