<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Appeal by Vancouver Airport Centre from a judgment finding it liable for certain material misrepresentations to investors in the Hilton Hotel. Sharbern cross-appealed against the dismissal of other claims against Centre. Centre developed and managed three hotels on the same site. The second was the Marriott, which opened in June 1998, and the third was the Hilton. Centre obtained a feasibility study for the Hilton from the same firm which provided a feasibility study for the Marriott, but was unsatisfied with the report and retained another firm. This firm eventually produced a report with more favourable financial predictions for the Hilton. It was included in a prospectus. The prospectus also included a statement that Centre was not in a conflict position as manager of the Hilton despite the risk that its similar role with the Marriott could affect its ability to meet its obligations to investors in the Hilton. Neither the Hilton nor the Marriott achieved the anticipated financial performance. Sharbern was one of the investors in the Hilton. It commenced a proceeding later converted to a class action, alleging that material misrepresentations concerning the financial projections and the lack of a conflict violated Centre's fiduciary obligations to the Hilton investors. The judge concluded that the applicable legislation gave rise to a deemed reliance by the investors on the representations contained in the prospectus. He found that Centre negligently misrepresented its conflict of interest and the agreements it had with Marriott investors, thereby breaching its fiduciary obligations to the Hilton investors. He did not find the use of the second, more favourable feasibility study in the prospectus a material misrepresentation. 	HELD: Appeal allowed and cross-appeal dismissed. The judge erred in finding that Centre misrepresented its conflict position with respect to its management of the two hotels. There was no evidence to support the assertion that Centre ever diverted business from the Hilton to the Marriott because of more favourable management contracts with the Marriott investors, or that it had the power to do so. The disclosure provided by Centre in the prospectus gave the Hilton investors all the information they required about the nature of the potential conflict. Centre breached no fiduciary obligation to the Hilton investors. It was entitled to use in the prospectus the financial projections it considered more reasonable. </summary>
