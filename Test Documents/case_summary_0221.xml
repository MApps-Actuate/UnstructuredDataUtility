<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>This was an appeal from a decision declaring that section 394(1)(b) of the Criminal Code violated section 11(d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and was not saved by section 1 of the Charter, and holding that it was of no force and effect and staying the proceedings under the section. The section was a reverse onus provision which was passed in 1910. The Crown submitted that such a decision could not be made in a vacuum and that no facts were adduced. However, the Crown was unable to suggest any other factual context which would aid the Court in considering whether the section was justified under section 1 of the Charter. Mine managers gave evidence but the trial judge found their conclusions to be unsupported by facts and evidence. There was no evidence of recent charges or convictions under the section. 	HELD: The appeal was allowed to the extent that all of section 394(1)(b) was struck down but dismissed with respect to the invalidity of the reverse onus clause. Only the words "he establishes that" were struck out. It was proper to proceed with a constitutional challenge to a criminal law provision in the absence of judicative facts. In dealing with section 1 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the concerns in question had to be concerns arising from the current circumstances of our society. There was insufficient evidence in this respect. The Crown did not met the onus of proving that the reverse onus clause was a reasonable limit within the meaning of section 1. </summary>
