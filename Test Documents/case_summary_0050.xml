<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Action by the purchasers of townhouse units for damages for breach of the Real Estate Development Act and breach of contract. The plaintiffs purchased their units with the belief that they could rent out the units as short-term vacation rentals. They argued the disclosure statement produced by the developer falsely indicated such rentals were permitted. The developer filed a disclosure statement which stated that purchasers would be able to rent their units on a weekly basis to members of the public subject to zoning restrictions. At the first strata meeting, a representative of the developer advised the owners that the project's zoning did not permit short-term rentals. 	HELD: Action allowed in part. The breach of contract claim was dismissed. The plaintiffs' primary purpose for purchasing the units was to obtain rental income. The statement respecting the ability to rent out the units was a material fact and was clearly misleading and false. Since the purchasers had no knowledge of the misrepresentation at the time of receiving the disclosure statements, and the developer knew at the time that the project was not zoned to permit short-term vacation rentals, the statutory defences were unavailable to the defendants. There was no evidence that the parties had expressly incorporated the representations in the disclosure statement into the agreement, nor was there evidence that the representations constituted an enforceable collateral contract. </summary>
