<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Trial of third party claim against Stanzel Plumbing -- Stanzel had removed plaintiff homeowner's oil furnace in 1979 when plaintiff converted heating to natural gas -- Oil tank, including oil fill pipe and vent pipe left in place at homeowner's request -- Stanzel turned oil fill pipe towards ground to indicate pipe no longer in use -- In 2001, defendant accidentally delivered oil to plaintiff's residence when deliveryman incorrectly read address on order -- When oil was pumped into tank, it was discharged through leaks and onto basement surface where it entered soil and groundwater -- House rendered uninhabitable and serious environmental contamination occurred requiring extensive remediation work -- Defendant admitted liability -- Defendant claimed contribution and indemnity from Stanzel alleging Stanzel was negligent in its decommissioning of plaintiff's fuel heating system -- HELD: Third party claim dismissed -- Stanzel did not create objectively unreasonable risk of harm -- At time Stanzel performed work, it was industry practice to run down oil fill pipe to ground to signal to any fuel delivery person that he was not to move it or he would loosen supply system and cause a leak in decommissioned oil fuel heating -- Stanzel's decommissioning was compliant with Code provisions at time -- In exercising its standard of care owed to homeowners, Stanzel could not have reasonably foreseen that a delivery of fuel oil that was not authorized by anyone and that was made in face of many indicators to the contrary would be made into that tightened and down-turned oil fill pipe. </summary>
