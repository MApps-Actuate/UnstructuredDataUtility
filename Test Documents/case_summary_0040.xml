As part of the investigation, the police decided to seek consent DNA samples from a known group of young men who were running around the night of the murder in the area. The accused and his brother were both asked to provide DNA samples. Before signing the consent form, the accused was advised of his right to free legal advice. He declined to consult counsel. The accused was asked and said he understood that if the lab result came back with a match, the police would arrest and charge him for murder. He also confirmed that he understood the results could be used in court. The argued he did not give his informed consent to police as he was not properly advised of his right to counsel. He also argued the evidence was inadmissible because the police practice of conducting a DNA canvass was a serious breach of privacy. 	HELD: The evidence was admissible. The accused gave a fully informed consent to the seizing of his blood for purposes of profiling his DNA. The accused was not detained when he was requested to re-attend at police quarters and asked to consent to the DNA sample. If he chose to seek legal advice prior to voluntarily giving a blood sample, he required advice for that limited purpose only. The accused had not proven he did not understand that this was an entirely voluntary process. He knew he could refuse and understood that he could speak to a lawyer at no charge if he wished to do so. The accused clearly declined to speak to a lawyer. Considering that the murder occurred in a small isolated community, that the accused knew the victim's family and he was in the vicinity of the victim's home prior to the murder, there was a close connection between the accused and the victim such that the request for his DNA was reasonable and did not offend his Charter rights. </summary>
