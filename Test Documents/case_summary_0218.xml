<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>This was an appeal from conviction and sentence on a charge of attempted murder. The victim was 15 years old and disabled. The accused, a 24-year-old man, was employed by the victim's mother as a part-time companion. One day the accused drove to the park where he savagely beat and kicked the victim and after unsuccessfully attempting to tie him to a tree, threw him in a creek. He fled when he saw a man approaching. The man testified that he saw someone running away, pulled the victim out of the creek and that another man told him that he had seen a big, hefty man hurriedly leave in a brown or maroon van. In the evening the police attended at the accused's residence and requested that he attend at the police station to which he agreed. He was taken for questioning as part of the investigation as there was no ground to consider him a suspect at that time. He was taken to an interview room and questioned while notes were taken. After the police noticed that he matched the description given by the man at the park he was arrested for attempted murder after admitting to beating the victim up. He was then given the police caution and advised of his right to counsel. He then said that he threw the victim in the river to drown him. The accused said that he felt that he was under arrest when he was taken to the interview room and did not ask to leave because he was sure the police would refuse to let him go. The trial judge did not accept this evidence and concluded that when he admitted to assaulting the victim he was not detained. The only question on appeal was whether the accused intended to kill the victim, an essential element of the charge of attempted murder. The accused alleged that the taking of his inculpatory statement infringed his rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter. He had a long-standing pattern of maladjustment and depression. His condition was considered treatable and counselling was recommended. He had recently made an attempt to turn his life around by attending school. 	HELD: The appeal from conviction was dismissed but the appeal from sentence was allowed. The trial judge's decision to admit the statement was based on his findings of fact and credibility. There was evidence to support his findings which could not be said to be unreasonable. The Court was not at liberty to interfere with his findings unless it was demonstrated that he erroneously instructed himself on the law governing the application of s. 10(b) to the facts of the case. The accused was not detained when he admitted committing the offence and was not deprived of his Charter rights under s. 10(b). In imposing sentence the trial judge failed to take into account the relevant mitigating circumstances. The accused was a first offender, he was not a danger to the public, he was very remorseful, the offence was unpremeditated and unplanned and no life- threatening weapon was used. The case did not fall into the extremely serious category which called for severe sentences for attempted murder. It was in the less serious range. The sentence was reduced from 15 to 8 years' imprisonment. </summary>
