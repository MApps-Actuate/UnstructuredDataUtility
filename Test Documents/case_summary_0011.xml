<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by the plaintiff for a declaration that she was a 50 per cent owner in the property, order that she be registered on title as a 50 per cent owner and that the property be sold and 50 per cent of net proceeds be distributed to her. The defendants were the plaintiff's son and daughter-in-law. In 2000, the plaintiff and her husband sold their home in Port Coquitlam and deposited the net proceeds of sale into the bank account of a company owned by their daughter's father-in-law in order to avoid having the proceeds seized by Canada Revenue Agency for tax arrears owed by the husband. After the sale of their home, the plaintiff and her husband moved into the basement suite of the defendants' home. Some alternations were done to the suite although there was a dispute as to how the alternations were paid for. In January 2002, the defendants purchased the property in issue. Prior to the purchase of the property, the plaintiff and her husband twice provided funds to the defendants in the amounts of $22,000 and $152,000. The $152,000 was in the form of a cheque from the bank account of the daughter's father-in-law's business and was alleged to have been the money deposited into the account by the plaintiff and her husband upon the sale of their home in 2000. The purchase price for the property was paid by mortgage proceeds, the money from the plaintiff and her husband and funds paid by the defendants themselves. The defendants were registered as the owners of the property. In 2004, the plaintiff's husband filed a voluntary assignment into bankruptcy and remained undischarged. The plaintiff and her husband lived with the defendants until 2006 when they went to live with another of their sons and his wife. The evidence of other family members was that discussions with the plaintiff and defendants indicated that the parties had purchased the house jointly. 	HELD: Action stayed until plaintiff gave notice of proceedings to husband's trustee in bankruptcy and made application to add trustee as defendant. The plaintiff and her husband advanced the sum of $174,000 to the defendants to assist them with the purchase of the property and to put the funds out of reach of creditors. The funds were not intended as a gift, but were advanced as a loan, the terms of which were that the plaintiff and her husband could continue to reside in the property for as long as they wished and that the funds would be repaid if they decided to leave. The plaintiff did not have an ownership interest in the property and there was no evidence supporting the intention that the plaintiff would be co-owner. As the husband was an undischarged bankrupt, his trustee in bankruptcy was a person who ought to have been joined to the proceedings. </summary>
