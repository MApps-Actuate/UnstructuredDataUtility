<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Appeal by Michel from the summary dismissal of her action against the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia as nominal defendant. Michel was walking when she was struck on the head by a rock which fell off a logging truck. The driver of the truck remained unidentified. Michel suffered severe injuries, including a permanent brain injury. She argued that the loose rock which fell off the truck should have been detected by a proper inspection by the driver and/or the owner of the truck. As the driver of the truck was unidentified, Michel sought a finding of liability on the part of the insurer. The trial judge held that Michel failed to establish a prima facie case of negligence, as it was not clear that the loose rock would have been discovered by a more thorough inspection. Accordingly, no breach of the standard of care could be inferred from the evidence. 	HELD: Appeal dismissed. The trial judge's conclusion that Michel's case was not proven was supportable. He correctly concluded that the fact that the rock came off the logging truck was not, by itself, sufficient to establish that the standard of care was breached. The trial judge did not err in concluding that the accident was equally as likely to have occurred without negligence as with it. </summary>
