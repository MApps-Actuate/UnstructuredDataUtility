<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Appeal of P from conviction. The appellant asserted that the trial judge erred in reversing the burden proof and in the admission of similar fact evidence. The judge at first instance had commented to the accused that there was no reason why one of the complainants would invent charges against him. This occurred during the cross-examination of the Crown, and the defence made no objection. The similar fact evidence admitted related to the evidence of K. The appellant argued that as P was acquitted in relation the charges with regard to K, K's evidence was inadmissible. 	HELD: Appeal dismissed. The judge's comments in relation to the reversal of the burden of proof were unfortunate and in error. K's testimony did not appear to influence the judge's appreciation of the evidence. </summary>
