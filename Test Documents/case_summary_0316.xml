<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>The plaintiff moved to amend his statement of claim to add a school board as a defendant -- The issue was whether a plaintiff who sought damages for sexual assault could sue the school board because the defendant's predatory behaviour was caused by his formerly being assaulted by a teacher, and the board knew it and knew that the student victim might become a sexual predator and commit similar offences -- The board argued there was no duty of care since there was no relationship of proximity to the plaintiff, and alternatively, that such duty ought to be negated by the policy consideration of indeterminate liability to an indeterminate class -- The board also argued it would suffer irremediable harm if the amendments were allowed -- HELD: The amendment was allowed -- The court could not find that the claim was impossible of success -- It was possible that given a full evidentiary record, including expert witnesses, a court could find that the circumstances of the relationship inhering between the plaintiff were of such a nature that the defendant might be said to be under an obligation to be mindful of the plaintiff's legitimate interests in conducting his or her affairs, or that on the evidence at trial, the defendant might be said to have had an obligation to be mindful of the plaintiff's interests in going about his or her business -- This could establish a relationship of proximity sufficient for a court to find a prima facie duty of care -- The proposed claim as alleged did not lead to the concern of indeterminate liability to an indeterminate class -- Only a limited class of plaintiff victims who suffered damage at the hands of a defendant who was sexually assaulted through the alleged negligence of the Board would have a claim for damages, and only if they could prove that the school board knew or ought to have known that its teacher was a paedophile who would molest children such as the defendant victim, who then would sexually assault, physically assault, emotionally abuse, torture and traumatize children, such as the plaintiff -- There was no evidence to support the board's submission of irremediable harm. </summary>
