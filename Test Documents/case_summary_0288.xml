<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by Rakowski for a declaration that Policy 17 of the Humber Students' Federation Policy and Procedure Manual and related provisions of its constitution were invalid -- Rakowski was a full-time student at Humber College Institute of Technology &amp; Advanced Learning -- He was a member of the Federation and aspired to run for president and to be a member of its board of directors -- Federation was a corporation without share capital and was incorporated under the Corporations Act -- Policy 17 dealt with director loyalty and commitment -- It provided that a director could not be a member, or hold a position on the board of directors, of any other student association or student advocacy group throughout his or her term as a director unless the association or group was sanctioned by the Federation -- Rakowski was a wheelchair user -- He was a member of a student association called the National Educational Association of Disabled Students -- This organization's mandate was the self-empowerment of disabled post-secondary students -- Association was not sanctioned by the Federation -- Rakowski's membership in the Association disqualified him from being a director or president of the Federation -- Rakowski would not resign but sought to have Policy 17 declared invalid -- HELD: Application dismissed -- Federation was similar to an association or club -- Courts traditionally were reluctant to interfere with the internal affairs of these organizations -- Court had jurisdiction in this matter -- Policy 17 was a reasonable and lawful policy for the governance of a student organization whose purpose was to represent the needs and interests of the student body of Humber and to advocate on their behalf -- It was not unreasonable, discriminatory, inconsistent with the objects of the Federation, contrary to public policy, contrary to the public interest or contrary to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms -- Policy 17 did not interfere with freedom of speech for if Rakowski was elected president of the Federation he could say whatever he wanted about the self-empowerment of disabled post-secondary students -- It did not interfere with freedom of association -- Rakowski was free to associate with the Association and also remain a member of the Federation -- He just could not be a director -- This qualification to becoming a director was a reasonable pre-condition for holding office -- It was reasonable for the Federation to demand that while a director advocated for Humber students, he or she did not advocate at the same time for another student organization -- Policy 17 was intended to avoid conflicts of interest -- There was therefore no basis to strike it down -- Policy 17 was also not enacted in bad faith -- It was motivated by the concern that a director's independence to be an advocate for Humber students was not diminished by obligations to be an advocate for another student association. </summary>
