<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by Brunswick News for an injunction restraining certain activities of Langdon, a former publisher of one of its weekly newspapers -- Langdon was employed by the applicant as the publisher of the Bugle-Observer -- His duties included management and authority over all aspects of operations, responsibility and supervision of 20 employees, and enhancement of the paper's distribution -- The written employment agreement and related documents survived termination of the agreement and required Langdon not to disclose trade secrets, customer lists, or other protected corporate information -- The parties did not otherwise enter any form of non-competition agreement -- Langdon resigned from the Bugle-Observer -- The next day he sought to place an advertisement in the paper soliciting employees for a new community newspaper that he intended to operate -- The applicant commenced proceedings for breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duties -- The applicant obtained ex parte injunctive relief and an Anton Piller order -- The applicant raised concerns about extensive confidential and proprietary information Langdon sent from his work e-mail account to his personal e-mail account -- The applicant submitted that the use of such information to operate a competing local newspaper irreparably damaged its paper in an unquantifiable manner -- The applicant sought to enjoin Langdon from operating the newspaper, use or disclosure of its confidential and proprietary information and any solicitation of employees, customers, suppliers, or advertisers -- Langdon deposed that he deleted the information and represented that he no longer had access to such information -- HELD: Application allowed in part -- There was a serious question to be tried on the basis of a possible breach of fiduciary duty by Langdon -- The balance of convenience regarding use of confidential information favoured the applicant -- Otherwise, the public interest in free competition prevailed -- In the absence of a non-competition agreement, Langdon was entitled to pursue employment without restriction except for the use of confidential information, or with respect to enticing former colleagues to breach their employment obligations -- The applicant did not have a monopoly over its advertisers or customers -- Langdon was free to solicit both, so long as such solicitation did not involve use of confidential information -- A limited injunction was granted on that basis. </summary>
