<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Motion by plaintiff bank for possession of a yacht in which it had a security interest pursuant to a general security agreement. The GSA was registered in 2001 under the Personal Property Security Act but the bank's interest in the yacht was not registered under the provisions of the Canada Shipping Act. John Marotta was granted standing as respondent to the motion as he purportedly acquired title to the yacht in 2008 by way of a bill of sale. He claimed his interest was superior to that of the bank because he registered his claim under the Canada Shipping Act while the bank did not. 	HELD: The bank's security interest as described in the GSA attached to the yacht as of April 17, 2004, and it had priority over any interest the respondent Marotta might have in the yacht. He was ordered to forthwith deliver possession of the vessel to the receiver. The bank acquired a perfected security interest in the yacht as of April 17, 2004 pursuant to the after-acquired property clause in the GSA of March 9, 2001 and the PPSA registration. That security interest had priority over any security interest arising from the SPA because the SPA was not registered pursuant to any registry system as of the date on which the numbered company became the legal owner. The CSA created two types of registers, a mandatory one and a voluntary one. As the yacht was a pleasure craft, the voluntary register applied. There was no legislation, federal or provincial requiring the bank to register under any other registry system in order to protect its interest. </summary>
