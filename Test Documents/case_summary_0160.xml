<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Motion by the plaintiff, New Brunswick Power Corporation, to strike the statement of defence and counterclaim of the defendant, Canash CCP Limited -- Motion by Canash, and the plaintiffs in a separate action, Dominion Ash Coal Combustion and Innova Ash, for consolidation of the separate action with Canash's counterclaim -- In the first action, New Brunswick Power claimed that Canash breached an exclusive marketing agreement and failed to pay invoices -- In its defence, Canash denied the breach and claimed damages for wrongful termination -- Canash further contended that New Brunswick Power used confidential information provided by Canash such that it interfered with its economic relationship with others -- In the second action, Dominion and Innova claimed that they were involved with Canash in developing a joint venture -- They contended that New Brunswick Power interfered with their economic relations with others, breached its duty to act in good faith, and misused confidential information provided to it -- New Brunswick Power sought to strike out portions of Canash's defence and counterclaim for failure to disclose a reasonable cause of defence, frivolous and vexatious pleadings, and pleadings that would unduly delay or complicate the trial -- Alternatively, New Brunswick Power sought judgment based on certain admissions at discovery -- HELD: Motions dismissed -- It was not clear that the matters pleaded by Canash did not constitute a defence -- Canash's assertion that the termination of the marketing agreement was linked to the termination of the joint venture negotiations was sufficient -- Although the defence and counterclaim made the matter more complicated, it was not unduly complicated and the pleadings did not render the matter unfair -- The admissions at discovery were not sufficient to meet the test for judgment -- It was too late and inappropriate to consolidate the matters, as it would require drafting of new pleadings and creation of a new action since Canash was defendant in the first action and plaintiff in the second -- However, it was appropriate to try the matters consecutively such that evidence in one proceeding was evidence in the other. </summary>
