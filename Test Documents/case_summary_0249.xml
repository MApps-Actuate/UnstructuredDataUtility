<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>This was a motion by the mother seeking leave to proceed before a case conference due to urgency and for an order allowing her to relocate the children to Paris, Ontario from London so that she could attend University. The court had ordered that the parents have joint custody with primary residence with the mother. The father was to have liberal access and the mother was to give 60 days notice if she intended to move. The children had always lived in London and the father exercised frequent access. Paris was 100 kilometres away. 	HELD: Motion dismissed. The move was a material change in circumstances and there was a genuine issue for trial. The fact that the order for custody did not prohibit the mother from moving was not definitive. There were no compelling circumstances or urgency requiring an order to facilitate the move or to hear the motion before a case conference. There was no strong possibility of the mother's success at trial. The proposed move was not in the children's best interest and the court's intervention to prevent the move was appropriate since the social, educational and medical realities of the children would be altered should she proceed with her plan before trial. </summary>
