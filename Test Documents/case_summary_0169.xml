<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by Cornerstone Baptist Church for determination of its interests, and the interests of the respondents, Peters and Saint John Parking Commission, arising from the sale of lands -- The applicant owned two parcels of land comprised of a parking lot and a church building no longer in use -- The parking lot was leased to the Commission -- The lease was registered and contained a term granting the Commission an option to make an offer in the event of sale of the lands -- In subsequent correspondence related to a possible sale, the Commission sought to fortify the clause to become an unambiguous right of first refusal -- That proposed sale never materialized -- The applicant subsequently offered the property for sale and received an offer from Peters -- The offer to purchase included a term granting Peters use of four parking spots at no cost -- The applicant notified the Commission of the sale and it sought to exercise the option to purchase the property on the same terms as Peters -- When the applicant advised Peters that it was unable to close the transaction, Peters commenced an action for specific performance or breach of contract -- The applicant submitted that the contract was frustrated by the Commission's exercise of its right to make an offer -- Peters argued that the applicant never provided notice of its obligations to the Commission, or that the Commission's consent was required regarding the parking lot condition -- Peters sought conversion of the application into an action and consolidation with his action -- The Commission asserted that its right of first refusal was not extinguished by the prior attempt to sell the property, and sought an order enjoining the sale of the lands to Peters -- HELD: Application dismissed -- The issues raised by the applicant were identical to those raised in the Peters action -- To allow the application to proceed raised the possibility of inconsistent results -- Material facts at issue made a trial necessary for determination of the matter, particularly regarding interpretation of ambiguities in the wording of the Commission's option -- Accordingly, the application was converted into an action and consolidated with the Peters action. </summary>
