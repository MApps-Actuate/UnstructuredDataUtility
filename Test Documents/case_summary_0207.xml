<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Three daughters of the deceased who were also administrators of his estate sought a declaration that certain accounts, tools and personal items held by the defendant were estate assets -- Two months before he died, the deceased had put the defendant, his friend, on his bank accounts -- The defendant claimed he was entitled to those accounts as the surviving joint owner, and that the other items were given to him by the deceased -- HELD: A declaration issued that the estate was entitled to beneficial ownership of the accounts, tools and personal effects -- The defendant owed the estate a duty to properly account with respect to these items and with respect to the power of attorney -- The burden of proof lay on the defendant to rebut the legal presumption that he was holding his bank accounts in trust for the deceased and his estate -- His evidence was not credible, and there were a number of conflicts on the oral and written evidence -- The court found that the deceased, who was 85 at the time, had a very limited understanding of what transpired at the bank when the defendant was added to his accounts -- His true intention was to put the defendant on his accounts for convenience, not to give him a beneficial interest in the accounts -- The accounts were estate assets -- The deceased was confused and did not have the capacity or intention to give his tools or personal items to the deceased after the death of his wife in 2006 -- The court was not convinced there was a valid gift of any of the items at an earlier time -- The defendant would pay $8,875 in costs. </summary>
