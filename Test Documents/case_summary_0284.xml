<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by the Ontario Professional Fire Fighters Association for a declaration that "contributory earnings" included all amounts paid to a firefighter in lieu of paid days off on public holidays or on days substituted for public holidays -- The Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System Board determined that these amounts were not to be included in the calculation of contributory earnings -- The Board found that if they permitted these amounts to be included in contributory earnings, it would advantage those who took pay in lieu of holiday -- The calculation of contributory earnings affected the amount of his or her pension benefit -- The issue was whether these amounts constituted overtime, and if they did, they were not to be included in contributory earnings -- HELD: Application dismissed -- The standard of review for the Board's decision was reasonableness simpliciter -- The Board's decision was reasonable -- Remuneration paid in excess of normal earnings was properly excluded. </summary>
