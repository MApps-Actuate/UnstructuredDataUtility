<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by the respondent City for an order that the matter be referred to the trial list and that it proceed as an action. The petitioner was in the business of supplying and distributing natural gas to industrial, commercial and residential ratepayers in British Columbia. It owned and operated a natural gas pipeline that ran underground through the City. The City was conducting work that involved the widening of a highway near where it intersected the pipeline. In order to ensure pipeline safety, it was necessary for the petitioner to perform certain work including making a temporary bypass of the pipeline, moving the pipeline and upgrading the infrastructure. The parties did not agree as to whether the costs of the petitioner in upgrading the pipeline should be borne or shared by the City. The City applied to the Oil and Gas Commission for leave to cross the pipeline with the highway project. In that decision leave was granted but the commission declined jurisdiction to consider the issue of costs. The City's application for judicial review of the decision was unsuccessful. The City proposed to start work on the highway regardless of whether or not the pipeline upgrades had been done. The petition brought these proceedings to resolve the issue of cost obligations. An injunction was granted against the City preventing the highway project from starting until the petitioner could upgrade the pipeline without prejudice to the rights of any party to argue the issues raised in the petition. The position of the petitioner was that the principal question was one of construction of an enactment or written contract and sought declaratory relief relating to the contractual or statutory regime governing the allocation of costs between the petitioner and the City for certain pipeline work. The position of the City was that it was not appropriate for the matter to be heard by way of petition as there was a bona fide triable issue as to whether the agreement was binding between the City and the petitioner and that to resolve the dispute between the parties it was in the interests of justice that there be pleadings and examinations for discovery. 	HELD: Application allowed. There was a bona fide triable issue as to whether the agreement between the parties was repudiated or terminated and whether it was still binding on the parties. The issue could not be justly resolved on the record before the court and there were areas of investigation that may be relevant. The City was entitled to discovery for the opportunity to uncover or develop evidence that was important to its case. It was fair and reasonable in achieving a just resolution to the matter that the City have production of documents from the petitioner and third parties and to conduct examinations for discovery. </summary>
