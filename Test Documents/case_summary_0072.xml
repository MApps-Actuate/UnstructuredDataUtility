<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Action by Wiebe against Peters for damages for personal injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident. Wiebe was a 37-year-old vinyl deck installer at the time of the accident. He was married with three children and lived an active lifestyle. He had undergone surgery related to a vasectomy a week prior to the accident and had returned to work for one day when the accident took place. Peters admitted liability for the accident, which involved Wiebe's truck striking the front of Peters' vehicle and both cars hitting a concrete abutment prior to coming to a stop. Wiebe described a jarring impact. He was left with some cuts, neck stiffness and aggravation of the incision site from his surgery immediately post-accident. He reported low back and pubic region pain to his family doctor. The doctor found Wiebe's range of motion in his spine was limited. Wiebe returned to work ten days after the accident. He continued to work but returned to his doctor six months later, reporting continued stiffness and pain, especially while working. His pain was initially on his right side only, but left-sided symptoms appeared a year nearly a year after the accident. Wiebe underwent physiotherapy and performed prescribed stretching exercises in the six year after the accident. He was also given a course of spinal injections but these provided only temporary relief. He changed jobs in 2007 and started doing less physical labour himself. His earnings were consistently $55,000. He rarely lost work time due to pain. His co-workers testified he was doing stretching exercises when he worked. Wiebe also developed pain in his shoulder, hands and knees, attributed to the type of work he was doing. He changed jobs because a management position was not available in the vinyl decking business, and earned a similar income with less benefits. His new job was considered less stable. Wiebe was examined by an orthopaedic surgeon at the request of the defence. The surgeon found Wiebe had no job limitations and reported he just needed to lose some weight. He considered disc degeneration that had occurred after the accident to be part of the general degenerative process and not associated with the accident. Wiebe admitted he attended a chiropractor four years prior the accident but denied he had any back problems at the time of the accident. His wife testified to personality changes that resulted from Wiebe's chronic back pain. 	HELD: Action allowed. Although Wiebe was experiencing ongoing degenerative disc changes prior the accident, these were not symptomatic. The pain he continued to suffer after the accident and to the date of trial was not a likely consequence of any pre-existing condition. He was likely to continue to suffer from back pain, which would restrict him from certain forms of physical activity including returning to work as a vinyl deck installer. Other physical complaints relating to Wiebe's work were far less disabling than the injuries he sustained in the accident. The court was satisfied Wiebe changed jobs because he could no longer perform the heavy physical work he did prior to the accident. It was likely Wiebe would require retraining in the future. He was awarded $75,000 for general damages, $125,000 for future income loss, special damages of $6,332 for physiotherapy and medication, and $10,000 for future care costs. </summary>
