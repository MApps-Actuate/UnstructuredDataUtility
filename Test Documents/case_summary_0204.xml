<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Motion by the defendant dentist to amend his statement of defence and for summary judgment dismissing the action. In the underlying action, the plaintiff sought damages for negligent dental work. The present issue was whether the claim was statute-barred. The defendant argued that his services were provided on October 24, 2002 and that he explained what had happened (namely, that a broken file had been imbedded in the plaintiff's tooth) at that time. The plaintiff claimed to have only discovered the drill bit embedded in his tooth on August 12, 2004. 	HELD: Motion granted. The action was summarily dismissed. The statement of claim was not filed until February 3, 2006. Accepting either date as the appropriate discovery date, the limitation periods in s. 52 of the New Brunswick Dental Act were applicable. The action was not commenced in time. </summary>
