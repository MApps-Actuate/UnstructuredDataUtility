<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Action by the owners of Cranberry Lane, a residential condominium complex, against their insurers, for coverage under their All-Risks Property Damage and Business Interruption Insurance Policy. The owners discovered in 2005 that one-third of the units in the complex were being used to house marijuana grow operations. Nine of the 29 units in which grow operations were discovered were identified by a tipster as housing such activity. The units had different owners who had rented the units at different times. Several of the units containing grow operations were located adjacent to each other. They incurred significant expenses and lost rental income over the time it took to restore the units to a habitable state. The insurance policy provided for a $50,000 deductible for each occurrence of illegal drug activity losses. The owners took the position the total losses of nearly $500,000 constituted one occurrence. The insurers maintained the losses from each of the 29 units where grow operations were discovered constituted a separate occurrence, attracting the application of several deductibles. A retired RCMP officer testified it was his opinion the grow operations at Cranberry Lane were coordinated. 	HELD: Action allowed in part. The owners bore the burden of proving there was only one occurrence of illegal drug activity. They failed to discharge this burden. The loss that occurred in one unit from the illegal activity taking place there had nothing to do with the loss in any other unit from the illegal activity taking place there. The fact that it was the same activity taking place in all the units did not serve to aggregate the losses. There was insufficient evidence to establish the grow operations were all part of a co-ordinated effort. It was pure speculation to suggest the fact some of the grow operations sat adjacent to each other meant they formed part of a common enterprise. This reasoning did not apply to the nine units reported by the tipster. These were subject to the application of one deductible only. Rental losses associate with remediation of each of the other 20 units were subject to the application of the deductible. Losses associated with the damaged reputation of the complex were subject to one additional deductible only. </summary>
