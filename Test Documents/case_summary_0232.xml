<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>This was a motion by the father for interim custody of the four-year old child. The parties resided in Ontario prior to and after separation. The mother then announced her intention to move to British Columbia to which the father made no objection. One month after the move, the father went to British Columbia to visit the child. Unpleased with the visit, he came back to Ontario and launched this motion, contending that the mother had moved to British Columbia without any real reason and without proper warning. The wife challenged Ontario's jurisdiction on the ground that the child's habitual residence was now BC. 	HELD: Motion dismissed. The party asserting jurisdiction had the onus of establishing that the jurisdiction asserted was the child's habitual residence. The evidence showed that the father made no objections to the mother moving to BC with the child; this amounted to consent or acquiescence, thereby making BC the child's habitual residence and precluding the exercise of the Ontario Court's jurisdiction. </summary>
