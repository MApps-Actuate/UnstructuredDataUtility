<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by the executor of the Brydges Estate for an order directing the respondent Bell Aliant Regional Communications Income Fund ("Aliant") to issue a replacement share certificate in the name of the estate to replace missing share certificates -- The executor sought to replace missing share certificates for shares in Bruncor Inc, a predecessor of Aliant, in order to redeem shares and complete the administration of the estate -- Aliant informed the executor that in order to issue new share certificates, its constituent documents required a commercial bond and a personal guarantee and indemnity from each beneficiary of the estate and from the executor -- The executor argued that Aliant was required to issue new share certificates without demanding for a bond under s. 80(2) of the Canada Business Corporations Act, that Aliant's constituent documents afforded a discretion as to whether to require a bond, that Aliant was required to act reasonably in the circumstances and that as the deceased was the registered owner of the shares, it made little difference whether the certificates still existed or not -- HELD: Application dismissed -- Aliant's requirement that the executor provide a commercial bond was supported by section 80(2) of the Canada Business Corporations Act and by its constituent documents -- Other factors such as the possibility that the shares could have been pledged to a third party, the consideration of who should bear the risk of a owner appearing with the missing certificates and the fact that the executor had not made sufficient inquiries as to the existence of the missing share certificates did not make it unreasonable for the respondent to require an indemnity bond -- However, it was not reasonable in the circumstances for Aliant to require personal guarantees or indemnities from the beneficiaries. </summary>
