<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>The appellants, the Attorney General for Ontario and the Chief Coroner, appealed from two decisions of an adjudicator of the Ontario Human Rights Tribunal holding that s. 10 of the Coroners Act violated s. 1 of the Human Rights Code for discriminating on the grounds of disability, in that inquests were mandatory for prisoners who die in police custody or in penal institutions, but discretionary for involuntary mental health patients who die in psychiatric facilities -- The tribunal ordered that an inquest be held into the death of the relative of each complainant, and the discretion of the Chief Coroner ought not be exercised -- The tribunal also awarded $5,000 in damages to each of the complainants, observing that each had struggled for a long period to have an inquest held, and each felt demeaned by the repeated refusals to hold an inquest -- HELD: The appeal was allowed, the tribunal's decision set aside, and the complaints dismissed -- The tribunal erred in finding discrimination -- Notwithstanding some reservations, the court could not say that the tribunal's finding with respect to the appropriate comparator group (inmates in custodial institutions) was unreasonable, considering the involuntariness of the confinement of both groups -- It was not evident from the reasons that the tribunal went on to do any analysis as to whether the differential treatment found amounted to discrimination -- Having found that there was differential treatment on the basis of mental disability and having concluded that the families of the deceased involuntary patients were denied a benefit, the tribunal concluded that there was discrimination without discussing the contextual factors -- The present Coroners Act required the Coroner to receive notice and to investigate all deaths of involuntary mental health patients and, indeed, all voluntary mental health patients in psychiatric facilities -- Thus, there was an individualized assessment of the death of an involuntary mental health patient, both in the legislation and as demonstrated in the circumstances of the complainants' family members, which recognized the vulnerability of these individuals -- Considered from the perspective of the reasonable person, it could not be said that the legislation perpetuated a stereotype or exhibited prejudice about the mentally ill -- There was significant evidence before the tribunal showing that correctional facilities were markedly more dangerous locations than hospitals, and therefore, they warranted greater scrutiny in the event that a death takes place -- Concerns about weapons were significantly greater, and the level of conflict was higher and of a more serious nature than in psychiatric facilities -- Moreover, there was extensive evidence showing that correctional facilities were less open to scrutiny and public oversight, as visitors to correctional facilities were not permitted into the living units -- By requiring mandatory notification and investigation of the deaths of involuntary mental health patients, but not mandatory inquests, the Act reflected the actual needs and circumstances of those patients, which were different from prisoners -- The distinction drawn by the legislation reasonably corresponded to the different needs and circumstances of the two groups and did not show a lack of respect for or loss of dignity to the mentally ill -- The Act treated voluntary and involuntary mental health patients in the same manner, and provided for heightened scrutiny of their deaths through a mandatory investigation -- A reasonable person would not find s. 10 of the Act discriminatory -- The public policy to require inquests into the deaths of persons in the limited circumstances outlined in the Act was not concerned with whether or not those persons suffered from a disability, but rather with the fact that they lived or worked in vulnerable circumstances that are dangerous and largely beyond public scrutiny -- Therefore, the Tribunal erred in finding discrimination, and the appeal was allowed -- Having determined there was no discrimination, the awards of damages had to fall. </summary>
