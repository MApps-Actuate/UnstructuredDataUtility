<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Appeal by the employer from decisions of the Labour Relations Board upholding hot declaration clauses in collective agreements. The appellant had collective agreements with the respondent unions; each agreement contained a hot declaration clause that permitted the union and its members to refuse to perform work that came from a third party employer involved in a lawful strike or lockout. The appellant argued that the clauses conflicted with the Labour Relations Code definition of strike and were therefore invalid. The British Columbia Federation of Labour had issued a hot declaration against Telus print advertising in connection with a protracted labour dispute between Telus and the Telecommunications Workers Union. The respondent unions advised the appellant that they were refusing to execute any Telus-related work, relying on the hot declaration clauses in their collective agreements. The appellant contended that the refusal to handle Telus advertising was a concerted activity restricting production or services under the definition. Strikes were prohibited during the term of collective agreements by s. 57 of the Code. 	HELD: Appeal dismissed. The Board's interpretation of the strike definition was not patently unreasonable. The Board made no reviewable error in its interpretation of the Code. It simply noted that the former s. 4.1 made hot declaration clauses unenforceable while it was in force and the subsequent amendments after its repeal did not provide any equivalent of that prohibition. The Board's approach did not depend on an implicit revival of the earlier interpretation merely as a result of the repeal, which might conflict with the interpretive principle stated in s. 37. Instead the Board concluded that the Code as amended contained no equivalent of s. 4.1 that precluded its preferred interpretation. The Board considered all of the relevant provisions of the Code and rationally integrated them into its rulings. It did not fail to take statutory requirements into account. </summary>
