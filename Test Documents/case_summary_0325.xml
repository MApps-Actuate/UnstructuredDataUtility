<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Sentencing of the accused for possession of a loaded restricted firearm and ammunition, breaching two previous weapons prohibition orders and possession of 4.76 grams of crack cocaine. The accused pleaded guilty. The accused, 24, had a supportive family. He had a Grade 9 education and performed mainly manual labour jobs but now was employed in a retail store. The accused had a prior related adult and youth record and had a history of re-offending. The accused served two years and five moths in pre-trial custody. 	HELD: The accused was sentenced to a total of seven years and four months imprisonment less four years and 10 months for pre-trial custody served. As the accused pleaded guilty only on the eve of trial, his conduct did not demonstrate real or genuine remorse, but rather, an attempt to accumulate pretrial custody so as to benefit from the two for one principle. He was not entitled to enhanced credit due to the prison conditions he faced. He made his choices knowing full well what the situation was at the jail. The present charges were extremely serious and the accused had not shown an acceptance of responsibility for his actions. His blatant disregard for the court orders indicated a conscious decision to continue a life of crime. The protection of society as well as the sentencing principles of general and specific deterrence and denunciation must be the paramount considerations when sentencing for offences involving loaded handguns. </summary>
