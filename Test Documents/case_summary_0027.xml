<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Appeal from decision of chambers judge which allowed Harrison's petition for an order to set aside decisions by the Information and Privacy Commissioner. Harrison commenced employment with an organization of the Ministry of Children and Family Development (MCFD) engaged to provide services to troubled youth. A woman disclosed confidential Ministry information to the organization, and advised them to ensure his work with the youth was supervised, based on an anonymous allegation of sexual abuse which had been made against Harrison. Harrison was fired two weeks after he began the job. The question was whether the Commissioner's determination that Harrison's claims that the MCFD had breached the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act was unsubstantiated was amenable to judicial review. The chambers judge found there was nothing in the Child, Family and Community Service Act which required the Commissioner to refrain from investigating Harrison's complaint regarding the information disclosed in purported reliance on s. 79(a) of the CFCSA. There was no privative clause in FIPPA, it was not apparent that the Commissioner had special expertise of a kind that ought to discourage judicial intervention, the question was one of law or of mixed law and fact and struck at the core of personal rights. All these factors supported a finding that the appropriate standard of review was correctness. The chambers judge found that the Commissioner's decision had resulted from an improper characterization of the issue. It was not obvious that FIPPA provided any meaningful or effective remedy. However, having exercised his discretion to hear the complaint, the Commissioner was required to consider whether the circumstances were such that he ought to order the personal information in the assessment file and any references to it to be expunged, or its use otherwise restrained due to s. 28 of FIPPA. The matter was remitted to the Commissioner for that purpose. The Commissioner's investigation, which looked at the consent to disclose and disclosure in the absence of consent, was unfair, as it ignored the consideration of the protection the Act was intended to afford individuals in relation to the use of their personal information. 	HELD: Appeal allowed, and the matter remitted to the Commissioner to consider only the issues raised by s. 28 of the FIPPA. The Commissioner's complaint investigation jurisdiction was limited to the director's powers, duties and investigations under FIPPA, but did not include investigation of a director's powers under s. 79 of the CFCSA because s. 79 was not a provision of FIPPA and was not incorporated into FIPPA. The chambers judge should have invited submissions with respect to s. 28 issues from the Attorney General and the woman who made the initial disclosure, and then remitted the issue to the Commissioner to properly consider it. Instead, the chambers judge, without hearing submissions or evidence from the Attorney General or the woman on her purported breach of s. 28, made findings of fact which he was without jurisdiction to make on judicial review. </summary>
