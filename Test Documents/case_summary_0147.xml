<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>The defendants moved for an order staying the underlying action for malicious prosecution and wrongful conviction pending a final determination of an application for ministerial review made by the plaintiff pursuant to s. 696.1 of the Criminal Code -- The plaintiff had been convicted of murder in 1975 and was still serving his life sentence, although he was now on parole -- After successfully applying to have the Minister investigate his conviction with respect to a possible miscarriage of justice, he brought a civil action against the present defendants, the former prosecutor and prosecuting authorities, who were involved in his criminal trial and conviction for murder -- In the underlying action, the plaintiff alleged that the defendants failed to disclose to him or his counsel potentially exculpatory evidence relating to conversations overheard by police officers between two other occupants of the vehicle involved in the shooting -- Presently, the defendants argued this action ought to be stayed on the basis that it constituted an abuse of process -- The plaintiff opposed the stay, as he was terminally ill with rectal cancer -- HELD: The motion seeking a stay was dismissed with $3,000 in costs -- The court was not persuaded that a stay ought to be granted in the particular circumstances of the case -- The line of authorities advanced by the defendants all recognized exceptions to the general rule, and this case would clearly fall within such exceptions -- The facts, if ultimately proven to be the case, clearly fell within the "fresh evidence" exception recognized -- Moreover, the plaintiff had always maintained his innocence, and having been successful in convincing the Minister to investigate his case, in a sense his criminal conviction might not yet be determined -- It would be inappropriate in the circumstances to prevent or further delay the plaintiff from pursuing his action at this very preliminary stage of the proceedings in this summary fashion, without any testing of the merits of the parties' respective cases and solely on the basis of the circular argument that he was already convicted of the offence -- Moreover, it would not serve the interests of justice in light of the plaintiff's present terminal health condition -- If the stay were granted, it was likely that he would not live to see his civil action proceed, let alone completed -- This could obviously result in significant prejudice to his case. </summary>
