<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Ruling respecting costs. The defendant insurer was successful and claimed costs on a partial indemnity basis of $538,334. The plaintiffs argued there should be no costs as this was a test case, novel, or a matter of public interest. The plaintiffs commenced the action as a potential class action. The plaintiff Ruffolo held long term disability insurance with the defendant. His benefits under the policy were offset by the amount of Canada Pension Plan benefits received by his children. He regarded the deduction as unlawful and contrary to public policy, and viewed the defendant's conduct as a breach of contract. His plan was to sue on behalf of several large classes of similarly situated insured persons who were members of long term disability plans issued by the defendant. The number of class members was substantial. He claimed damages of $10 million and punitive damages of $1 million. Another individual plaintiff was added as well as the Law Foundation. In defending the claim, the defendant incurred legal fees of $761,937 and disbursements of $411,691. At a case conference, the parties agreed to proceed with the individual claims only. The trial lasted five and one-half days. The Law Foundation provided support to the plaintiffs and thus would be responsible for paying the defendant's costs. 	HELD: The defendant was awarded costs of $215,000. Although the action did not proceed as a class action, the action was not outside the Class Proceedings Act and s. 31(1) of the Act applied. The effect of s. 31(1) of the Class Proceedings Act was that for proceedings under the Act, the court should be more willing to find that the case was a test case, the determination of a novel point of law, or the adjudication of matters of public interest and award costs accordingly. The action was technically a test case. No weight was given to this factor, however, as the defendant cooperated in having the action proceed as it did, and its cooperation should not preclude it from claiming costs. Although the action raised novel points of law, the novelty of the interaction of public law with private contracting did not rise to the level that would justify totally denying the defendant its costs. The costs awarded were justified by the amount in issue in the litigation, the importance of the issues, the complexity of the proceedings, including the allegation that the defendant should be liable for punitive damages, concerns about access to justice, particularly in class proceedings, and the principle that the costs of litigation should be reasonable and have regard to the reasonable expectations of the losing party. </summary>
