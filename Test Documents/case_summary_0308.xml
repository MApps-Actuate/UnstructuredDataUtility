<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by plaintiff Credit Union for summary judgment -- Defendants were insurers of plaintiff pursuant to fidelity bond issued in plaintiff's favour -- Plaintiff made claim under bond after its general manager, Simmons, in collusion with other employees, dishonestly or fraudulently removed $432,000 from plaintiff's vault, improperly authorized over $1 million in overdrafts by fraudulently increasing overdraft limits for herself, her family and other members, and improperly granted personal loans and mortgages to members who already possessed substantial dishonestly obtained overdrafts -- Simmons created fictitious documents and authorized false transaction records to hide her wrongdoing for many years -- Directors of plaintiff swore affidavits indicating they had no knowledge of scheme -- Defendants denied liability on grounds that Simmons's conduct was not covered under bond, as conduct was "unfaithful performance" and not "dishonesty" or "fraud", or alternatively, defendants claimed plaintiff did not file Notice of Loss within 20 days of discovery of loss -- Defendant also argued substantial portion of losses were excluded as "indirect or consequential", which included interest -- HELD: Application allowed -- There was no genuine issue for trial in relation to plaintiff's entitlement to recover under bond -- Coverage in insurance contracts was to be interpreted broadly in favour of insured, and exclusion clauses were to be interpreted strictly and narrowly against insurer -- To accept defendants' argument that Simmons and colluders were merely guilty of "unfaithful performance" would deprive bond of any commercial value -- Simmons and colluders committed fraud, false pretences, and forgery, and their actions were thereby embraced by clear wording of fidelity bond -- Fact that they were also guilty of unfaithful performance did not exclude insurer from obligation to honour bond -- It was irrelevant whether Simmons intended to cause plaintiff loss, as consequences were intended when there was a conscious awareness that they were the result of one's actions -- Plaintiff could not have discovered loss sooner, as investigations and reports by Ministry of Financial Institutions and Ministry of Finance raised no serious concerns -- Loss was not discovered until September 11, 2001, and notice of potential claim against bond was given three days later -- Court totaled plaintiff's losses, and added $25,000 for audit expenses plus $25,000 for forensic investigation expenses, as provided in bond agreement -- Lost interest and services charges were not recoverable under bond, as these constituted profit for plaintiff, and were indirect losses excluded by terms of policy. </summary>
