<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Motion by father to vary a 2002 court order with respect to child support. The parties had three children, ages 18, 17, and 10. The youngest child was living with the mother. Under the prior order, the father had been ordered to pay $2,666 per month for child support for the three children based on his estimated annual income of $237,000. However, now the eldest child was living with the father and he was paying her post-secondary education expenses. The middle child was now living elsewhere, and the father was also supporting her. The mother did not contribute to the support of the two elder children. The main issue was establishing the father's income for child support purposes, as he was the owner/manager of a corporation. 	HELD: Father would pay $1,886 per month in child support for the youngest child, based on an imputed income of $508,338. He would pay $139,840 in arrears of child support. The amount of child support would be adjusted annually. The father had been very transparent in his business practices. Although the father exercised sole control over the corporation, it did not mean that there were grounds to impute income for all the retained income. The father had always paid himself a salary that was appropriate for an owner-manager. He was not unreasonably building up savings. A total of $139,840 in arrears of child support was owing for Jan. 2003 to Dec. 2007, less moneys paid. On an ongoing basis, it was appropriate to continue the practice contemplated in the 2002 order, whereby an adjustment to child support payable was made every June. In addition, every four years, the experts would analyze the father's income from the corporation to know that the father's income tax returned showed a fair and reasonable income given the child support obligation. The parties would share extraordinary expenses in proportion to their incomes. Most of the expense would be incurred by the father, as the mother had no independent income. The father would pay an additional $75 per month in miscellaneous expenses. </summary>
