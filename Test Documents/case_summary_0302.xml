<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by owners for order that lands were not "eligible property" within meaning of s. 447.70 of Municipal Act -- Lands originally comprised one parcel of 38.08 acres, but were severed in 2000 into two parcels -- Section 447.70 of Municipal Act provided that eligible property included property that was subdivided or subject to a severance -- As a result, parcels were added to Assessment Roll in 2001 -- Applicants argued that lands were not "eligible properties" because definition did not come into force until January 1, 2001, and it could not apply to a severance that took place in 2000 -- Act had been amended to provide tax caps on certain protected properties, which remained in place unless there were certain types of changes to properties -- Those properties then became "eligible properties" subject to tax increases of up to five per cent per year or, if lower, the same average effective rate as up to six comparable capped properties in the vicinity -- Town submitted that statute was not retroactive, but retrospective, in that it operated for the future only, but imposed new results in respect of a past event -- HELD: Application dismissed -- Definition of "eligible properties", insofar as it included lands subdivided or severed, operated retrospectively and not retroactively -- It identified parcels of land created by a past event (severance) and attached new consequences (taxation) for the future -- Common-law presumption against applying retroactive legislation did not apply unless legislation interfered with vested rights -- Applicants had no vested rights -- Liberal interpretation was to be given to Act, purpose of which was stated to be to ensure that eligible properties were taxes at same level as comparable properties -- Even though other sections of Act contained specific references to events that happened in stated years, absence of such a subsection was not determinative of legislature's intent in respect of wording in issue, which had to be determined from purpose underlying provision. </summary>
