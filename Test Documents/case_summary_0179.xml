<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Motion by the plaintiff for summary judgment against the defendants and for recovery of two vehicles owned by the plaintiff. The defendant worked as the plaintiff's subcontractor in the dismantling of buildings. The plaintiff had not paid all outstanding bills to the defendant since it alleged the defendant billed for work not performed. The two vehicles were taken by the defendant for a safety inspection. The defendant then refused to return the vehicles. The safety inspections had not been performed, nor was there any evidence the defendants had done any other work on the vehicles. The defendants claimed they had an equitable or common law lien over the vehicles for the amount of the outstanding accounts. 	HELD: Motion allowed in part. The defendants did not have a common law lien in the vehicles and had no lawful claim that entitled them to possession of the plaintiff's vehicles. The plaintiff was entitled to return of the vehicle. </summary>
