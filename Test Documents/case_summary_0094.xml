<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Action for wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff, 41, was the general manager of the defendant hotel with a base salary of $150,761. She was terminated without notice in 2006 for insubordination after she had refused to follow instruction concerning the preparation of the hotel's 2007 budget. The plaintiff, who was ultimately responsible for the preparation of the annual budget, had submitted a budget that did not meet the expectations of the defendant. The corporate executive directed the plaintiff to submit a budget that projected a profit for 2007 that was significantly greater than that projected in the budget approved by the plaintiff. According to the defendant's accounting policy at the time, the annual budget was to be prepared and approved conjointly by the executive team and the corporate executive. The plaintiff was of the view that the profit projections for the hotel dictated by the defendant were neither reasonable nor achievable, and that the unilateral directive of the corporate executive to change the budget numbers was contrary to the budgeting process required by the defendant's own accounting policy. She told her corporate superiors that she could not submit the budget as directed and was terminated. She had worked for the defendant for 12 years. Since her dismissal, the plaintiff was unable to find similar alternate employment. 	HELD: Action allowed. The plaintiff was entitled to her annual base salary plus benefits and bonuses during the notice period. As general manager of the hotel, the plaintiff held a significant executive position within the hotel. She was expected to exercise independent judgment, and was accustomed to having her judgment respected. The defendant's directive to the plaintiff and her controller to prepare and sign off the budget as directed was contrary to the defendant's accounting policy which emphasized mutuality, cooperation and agreement in the preparation and approval of the budget. The defendant was not entitled to insist that the plaintiff direct her controller to make the changes to the budget and submit them as the hotel's budget when neither she nor her controller believed the budget was reasonable or achievable. An employee was as entitled as the employer to rely on policies governing the employment relationship. The employer was not entitled to ignore its own policies when it suited its purposes. The plaintiff's concerns about the budget were not unreasonable or unfounded. They were concerns shared by her experienced executive team. The plaintiff's refusal to comply with the defendant' directive was not insubordination because it was a directive that the defendant was not entitled to issue. The plaintiff was entitled to 15 months notice, considering that she always worked in the hotel industry and her work was highly specialized. Her mitigation costs were costs that she would have incurred in any event and were not recoverable. </summary>
