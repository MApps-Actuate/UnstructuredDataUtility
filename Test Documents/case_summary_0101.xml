<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by the plaintiff, MacMillan Tucker MacKay, for an interlocutory injunction restraining the defendant, Pyper, from practicing law within a five-mile radius of its business offices. The plaintiff was a small law firm comprised of two partners, an associate counsel and three associates. They were one of three law firms with offices in a small town center located within a larger municipality. The defendant was formerly employed by the plaintiff as an articling student and an associate upon his call to the bar. The employment contract contained a non-competition clause that was discussed prior to execution. The clause prohibited practice within a five-mile radius of the plaintiff for a three year period following cessation of employment with the firm. The defendant left the firm after building an extensive practice over a five-year period. The defendant intended to practice in his own law office located within the radius of the non-competition clause. He signed a ten-year lease and committed to certain leasehold improvements. The defendant mistakenly believed that the geographic limitation in the clause was five kilometres rather than five miles. The plaintiff refused to waive or amend the clause. A joint letter was sent to clients informing them of the defendant's departure and advising them of their right to either retain the defendant or keep their work with the plaintiff. The plaintiff sought to enforce the non-competition clause. 	HELD: Application dismissed. The non-competition clause was clear and unambiguous. However, the plaintiff failed to establish a prima facie case that the clause was enforceable. The plaintiff did not demonstrate that it was vulnerable to the loss of business as a result of the departure of the defendant. The geographic and time restrictions were not reasonable to protect its proprietary and business interest in its clients. Rather than purporting to restrict solicitation of clients, the covenant precluded the defendant from pursuing his profession for three years within a certain radius of the plaintiff's office regardless of whether his clients came from the plaintiff. The restriction was thus overly broad. Each party was likely to suffer irreparable harm given an adverse result. The balance of convenience weighed against granting an injunction, as the public interest was not served by restrictions on the right of qualified professionals to practice at the location of their choice. </summary>
