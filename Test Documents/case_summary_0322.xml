<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Motion by the defendant province to strike out portions of the statement of claim after the plaintiffs refused to provide particulars before the province filed a defence. The plaintiffs commenced a proposed class action against the city and the province on behalf of victims of a 2005 outbreak of Legionnaires' Disease and Pontiac Fever in an old age home. The plaintiffs alleged the province's public health laboratory failed to detect the disease in a timely manner through the use of an inappropriate test and that as disease was not diagnosed, this delayed timely and effective treatment with appropriate antibiotics, resulting in illness and death to class members. The province alleged that it required certain of the particulars in order to plead. 	HELD: Motion allowed in part. The plaintiffs were ordered to provide particulars to identify the public health division and provide particulars of its alleged operational responsibility and the manner in which it failed to coordinate the response of health care providers, including hospitals. There were no other allegations in the consolidated statement of claim that were so bald or conclusory as to warrant striking, particularly without leave to amend. A fair reading of the claim in its entirety provided a cogent body of fact which was sufficient for the defendants to plead. </summary>
