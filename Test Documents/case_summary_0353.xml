<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Appeal by the Law Society from a decision of the Appeal Panel which reversed the Hearing Panel's decision refusing to reinstate the respondent's membership in the Law Society. The respondent, a judge, had been found guilty of serious misconduct. He had resigned and sought reinstatement into the Law Society. The Hearing Panel held that the respondent had the burden to present clear and convincing proof based on cogent evidence that the reinstatement should be granted. The Hearing Panel dismissed his application on the ground that insufficient time had passed since the misconduct, the character witnesses who testified on the respondent's behalf did not accept that he committed the conduct complained of and that the respondent had not proven he was extremely unlikely to re-offend. The Appeal Panel held that the Hearing Panel erred in law by restricting its jurisdiction to only the two options of restoration without conditions or refusal to restore. The Appeal Panel also held that the Hearing Panel erred in the standard of proof it applied. The Appeal Panel then determined the matter on the merits and held that the psychiatric evidence supported a finding that there was a low risk the respondent would re-offend and concluded that he had learned his lesson. 	HELD: Appeal dismissed. The Appeal Panel correctly held that there was jurisdiction to impose conditions on a person on whose membership was restored under s. 31(3). The failure of the Hearing Panel to appreciate that conditions could be attached to the restoration of a licence compromised the reliability of its ultimate conclusion that restoring the respondent's licence was not in the public interest. The Appeal Panel correctly found that the simple civil standard of the balance of probabilities applied. The finding of the Appeal Panel that the Hearing Panel's error as to the standard of proof undermined its decision to such an extent that its conclusions could not stand was reasonable. Although the Appeal Panel was not correct in its ruling on the burden of proof, it applied the burden of proof identified by the Hearing Panel and therefore did not fall into error. </summary>
