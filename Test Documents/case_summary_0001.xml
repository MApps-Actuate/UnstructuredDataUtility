<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Appeal by the accused, LP and RB, from conviction for aggravated assault, and appeal by RB from sentence. LP punched the victim in the head and knocked him to the ground. As the victim was falling, LP struck him in the head two more times. As the victim was lying on the ground with his hands covering his head, RB directed a kick at his head. The victim did not appear to be hurt, but after he went home he developed symptoms which resulted in a trip to the hospital. He had suffered a depressed fracture of the skull and required surgery. He was in a coma for several months. Both accused were sentenced to one year in secure custody followed by a period of probation. They argued that they should have been convicted of assault rather than aggravated assault. They claimed that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence as to causation of the victim's injury. They argued that the trial judge should have drawn an adverse inference from the Crown's failure to call the victim. They also argued that the trial judge erred in failing to consider whether they had the necessary fault element to support a conviction for aggravated assault, in finding that the two of them acted jointly, and in failing to consider relevant evidence in concluding that an innocent explanation for the injuries had been fabricated. 	HELD: Conviction appeals dismissed and sentence appeal allowed. The trial judge's findings on the issue of causation were reasonable, were not tainted by any material misapprehension of the evidence, and did not suggest a reversal of the onus of proof. The trial judge did not refer to the Crown's failure to call the victim, meaning that the judge either did not draw an adverse inference, or was satisfied with the Crown's explanation, neither of which was a reversible error. The risk of bodily harm was an objectively foreseeable consequence of the administration of several punches and a kick to the head, so the existence of a requisite fault element was not a live issue by the end of the trial. It was open to the trial judge to find that the two accused acted together as joint perpetrators of the assault. The conclusion that the innocent explanation was concocted was firmly rooted in the evidence. With respect to sentence, the trial judge erred in finding that the injuries suffered by the victim were reasonably foreseeable at the time of the assault, and in failing to give sufficient weight to the circumstances surrounding the assault. RB's sentence was reduced to six months of secure custody followed by probation. </summary>
