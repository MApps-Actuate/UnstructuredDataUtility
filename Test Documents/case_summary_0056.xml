<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by Tylon for leave to appeal from an order discharging a builders lien on payment of security of $90,000. Security for costs was not a part of the order. Tylon constructed a home for the Pont in 2008. It submitted an invoice to them in July for $375,175 and filed a lien for $255,982 in September. The Ponts claimed they had already paid $211,571 to Tylon. In court, Tylon took the position that it should have filed the lien for $375,175. The court concluded that the lien was an abuse of process and ordered its discharge upon the payment of $90,000. He deducted from the amount of the lien a payment already made by the Ponts to Tylon. 	HELD: Application dismissed. Allowing Tylon to appeal from the interlocutory order would hinder the process of the litigation between the parties. It was for the court to decide on a full record whether or not Tylon was entitled to compensation for the value of the work it completed as opposed to the unpaid amount on the invoice. No error was apparent in the judge's decision not to order security for costs. </summary>
