<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Motion by the plaintiff, the Royal Bank of Canada, for summary judgment against the defendants, Profor Kedgwick and Isabelle, and cross-motion by the defendants for leave to amend their statement of defence -- The defendants separately guaranteed a debt owed by a bankrupt company, Heritage, to the plaintiff -- Neither defendant paid anything under their respective guarantees -- In a previous hearing, portions of the statement of defence and a counterclaim were struck in so far as they related to derivative claims belonging to Heritage, a non-party to the action -- The defendants now sought to amend their defence to plead that the plaintiff did not provide a reasonable time to permit Heritage to comply with its demand for payment -- They further contended that improper actions of the plaintiff taken against Heritage disentitled it to payment under the guarantees -- The plaintiff contended that the proposed amendment was essentially the same as a struck paragraph -- The plaintiff submitted that the remaining paragraphs of the defence did not disclose a defence against the plaintiff's action on the guarantees -- HELD: Motion and cross-motion allowed -- The amendment was permitted, save for any reference to Heritage -- The argument that the plaintiff did not give reasonable time to comply with its demand for payments was bona fide -- There was no prejudice that could not be compensated for by costs or an adjournment -- However, the defendants were given 45 days notice of the plaintiff's demand -- There was no evidence that they took steps to negotiate with the plaintiff -- Nor did they take steps to establish that the alleged improper conduct of the plaintiff constituted a material variation disentitling it to enforce against them as guarantors -- Nor did they establish that a material variation had occurred -- The plaintiff was accordingly granted summary judgment. </summary>
