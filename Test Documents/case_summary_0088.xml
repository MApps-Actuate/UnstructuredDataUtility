<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Action by the insured for indemnity from the insurer for the value of the insured vehicle. The insured was in the business of providing lease financing for credit challenged clients. In order to ensure that the risk of nonpayment was reduced, the insured installed an immobilizer that was hardwired to the ignition system and was activated upon non-payment. One the insured's clients had leased the vehicle in question. When she failed to make the lease payments by the date required, the immobilizer was activated on the vehicle. The vehicle had been parked several blocks from the client's residence to avoid repossession and buy her some time to make the payments. Several weeks after the immobilizer was activated, she noticed the car was missing and police were called. The vehicle was never located. The insurer alleged that the client had concealed the vehicle. 	HELD: Action allowed. The client did not abandon the vehicle. Her clothes and supplies were still in the car. The court accepted her evidence that had parked the car in an effort to avoid repossession and to buy some time so that the delinquent payments might be addressed. She saw the vehicle almost daily after having parked it. She did not participate in the disappearance of the car. There was no evidence or suggestion that the client intended to conceal the car in order to secure insurance funds. At best, she concealed it from the insured but not from the insurer. </summary>
