<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>This was an action for damages for wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff started employment with the defendant in September 1959 as a clerk; over the years he was promoted through more responsible positions until he was ultimately made director of revenue accounting in March 1984. He was terminated without any advance warning on November 13, 1984. His earnings on termination had reached $48,000 annually. He was born in Trinidad and received his Grade 13 education there, which was the extent of his formal schooling; he was never employed by other than the defendant. His marketability was limited. The defendant at the time he was terminated offered to pay salary and benefits for six months, and for an additional three months thereafter if he was actively seeking employment; the defendant also offered the plaintiff Life Management Centre services, which ultimately cost the defendant $6,000. 	HELD: The action was allowed. There was a merger in 1984 of two companies that ultimately became Canadian Pacific Express and Transport Limited with resulting duplication of positions; a great deal of down-sizing had to take place and some 250 persons were let go over a short period at all levels. The plaintiff's position was simply abolished. The defendant was motivated by business considerations alone. The plaintiff was at the mid-to upper managerial level. It is not easy for such a man to find suitable employment and the plaintiff had not found any at the time of trial. The evidence did not bear out the defendant's contention that the plaintiff made no real effort to mitigate his loss; the defendant did not meet the burden of showing not only a lack of effort on the plaintiff's part but also that there was employment available. The company made a serious attempt to assist its employee and it may have thought sincerely it was being fair. Its offer fell short of the mark however: the offer was unreasonable by any standard. The court fixed at 18 months the period which it considered fair to the plaintiff. </summary>
