<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Voir dire to determine admissibility of evidence at the trial of the accused, Libby -- The accused's estranged wife took CDs to Grand Falls police and stated that they belonged to the accused and contained child pornography -- Police placed the discs in a computer, opened the files and viewed the contents -- Police attended the marital home and removed a computer -- Police browsed the computer's files but found no evidence of child pornography -- At the request of the RCMP, the accused voluntarily turned over a second computer based on limited consent -- The RCMP swore an information to obtain a search warrant based on the information obtained in Grand Falls -- The RCMP refused a request by the accused to return his computer -- Forensic analysis revealed child pornography -- The first computer was re-seized pursuant to a warrant, however, the information did not mention the initial warrantless seizure -- Both warrants expired without charges being laid -- Police eventually obtained child pornography images from copies of the hard drives -- The accused was eventually charged with possession of child pornography -- HELD: The CD images were inadmissible and the hard drive evidence was admissible -- The accused had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the CDs and the information thereon -- Police were required to obtain a search warrant or consent before seizing the CDs and searching them -- The accused's wife did not have authority to grant legitimate consent to police given her separation from the accused -- The viewing of the images was not akin to the gathering or finding of evidence and constituted a warrantless search that infringed the rights of the accused -- The evidence was excluded due to the serious violation of the accused's privacy interest and the non-technical nature of the breach -- The warrants were validly issued, as the conduct of police did not subvert the process or constitute deliberate non-disclosure -- Expungement of the material seized in violation of the accused's rights did not affect the validity of the warrants, as the remaining information provided by his wife was sufficiently reliable -- Retention of copies of the hard drives past the warrant expiration dates was permissible as per s. 490(13) of the Criminal Code -- The searches of the drives were authorized by warrant and thus no breach of the accused's rights occurred in that respect. </summary>
