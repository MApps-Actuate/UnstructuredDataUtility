<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>The defendants moved for an order staying or dismissing the present action on the basis that another proceeding was pending in the Superior Court between similar parties in respect of the same subject matter; alternatively, that the allegations of abuse of process should be struck on the basis that no reasonable cause of action was disclosed; alternatively, striking out the allegations of conspiracy as being insufficiently pleaded; and lastly, striking out portions of the statement of claim as against the non-corporate defendants -- HELD: The statement of claim was struck with leave to the plaintiff to deliver a statement of defence and counterclaim in the other action -- The plaintiff could have delivered a counterclaim, and the court inferred that he chose not to for strategic reasons -- It would be an abuse of the process of the court to allow parallel proceedings for strategic reasons -- It would work an injustice against the defendant if the present action was allowed to proceed, whereas the stay of the action would not cause an injustice to the plaintiff -- This was not a case where the deficiencies in the pleading could be addressed by allowing an amendment. </summary>
