<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Appeal by the accused Morley from her convictions for impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level over .08 -- Morley drank large quantities of alcohol immediately before driving -- She advanced a defence of bolus drinking -- This pattern of drinking could produce a much higher blood alcohol level at the time of the test than what existed at the time of driving -- Morley's blood alcohol level was between .247 and .267 -- No statutory presumption existed to prove her impairment because readings were taken outside of the Criminal Code time limit -- HELD: Appeal allowed -- Morley was acquitted -- Crown failed to negative Morley's defence based on bolus drinking -- There was no evidence which contradicted the possibility that Morley engaged in bolus drinking just prior to the accident -- Morley was not subjected to a new trial because she would be exposed to double jeopardy -- Crown did not satisfy its affirmative obligation to eliminate a defence that was not new. </summary>
