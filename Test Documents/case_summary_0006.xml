<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Appeal by the defendant from the damages of $70,000 for non-pecuniary loss and $125,000 for loss of future earning capacity awarded to the respondent for injuries he sustained in a motor vehicle accident. The respondent, 25, sustained soft-tissue injuries to his chest, neck, and right shoulder in the collision. He was continuing to suffer from debilitating headaches and persistent back pain and those conditions had a significant impact on his quality of life. At the time of the accident, the respondent was employed by a production company for a television series and had just been promoted from office production assistant to executive producer's assistant. His career aspiration was to be a writer/director for live-action television and movies. The appellant argued that the trial judge made several evidentiary and procedural errors that prejudiced the defence and led to excessive awards of damages. The defendant argued that the award for loss of future earning capacity was speculative and reflected palpable and over-riding error. The appellant argued that the trial judge erred in law by refusing to admit the clinical notes of the appellant's family physician as admissions against interest. The appellant sought to rely on the clinical notes to support the inference that the respondent did not complain to the doctor of the symptoms he alleged because the notes did not contain any reference to those symptoms. 	HELD: Appeal dismissed. The appellant sought to have the clinical records admitted, arguing an admission by omission. The notes standing alone were of little weight for the purpose intended by the appellant. It was appropriate to limit their use to refreshing the memory of the doctors during their testimony. Any evidentiary value attached to the notes was merged in the testimony of the doctors and there was no prejudice to the appellant arising from their formal inadmissibility as admissions against interest. The trial judge did not err in refusing to allow the appellant to ask the physician if statements made by the respondent at his discovery were fair comments. It was improper to ask a witness to comment on the credibility of another witness by agreeing or disagreeing with what the other witness had said. The trial judge erred in refusing to allow the appellant to put to the respondent questions and answers from his examination for discovery. The appellant was, however, able through cross-examination, to elicit the same admissions that were made on discovery by the respondent. The appellant was thus not prejudiced by the trial judge's error. The plaintiff sustained more than mild soft tissue injuries and the award for non-pecuniary damages was not inordinately high based on those facts. The effect of the headaches and back pain attributable to the accident impaired the respondent's ability to take advantage of opportunities that his position as an executive producer's assistant and potential promotions would have presented to him. The evidence supported the trial judge's assessment of loss of future earning capacity. </summary>
