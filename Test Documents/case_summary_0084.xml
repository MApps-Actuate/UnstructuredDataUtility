<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by the mother for variation of a custody order and for custody of a nine-year-old child. The mother absconded with the child to Russia in 2004. Since that time, the father had custody. The mother did not return the child until 2006. The parents hated each other. The father was suspicious of everything the mother did and interpreted what the mother did as having a negative impact on the child. The father would not disclose what he was doing with the child when the child was with him. The mother had previously sought to obtain custody unsuccessfully. The mother alleged that the father had breached the prior custody order by frustrating the mother's access to the child. 	HELD: Application dismissed. The circumstances that the mother pointed to as being changes were the same things she complained about in the prior trial which resulted in the order that the mother sought to vary. There was no change in circumstances as such that would permit the court to vary the order. There was no change that had altered the child's needs or the ability of the parents to meet those needs since the last trial and order. Even if there were a significant or material change in the circumstances, the court would not change the present order as the best interest of this child at this time was for the child to remain with the father and the mother to have liberal and general access. </summary>
