<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by Zhang et al, Falun Gong supporters, to stay an order requiring them to remove a billboard and hut from the front of the Chinese consulate. The hut and billboard were part of a protest vigil that the applicants had maintained for seven years, in an attempt to bring attention to human rights abuses by the Chinese government. The City had requested the removal of the structures several times as they contravened a City bylaw respecting sidewalk use. When the applicants failed to cooperate, the City obtained the order from which the applicants had filed an appeal. 	HELD: Application dismissed. Although the applicants would suffer harm if they had to remove their structures from in front of the consulate, the harm was not irreparable as there were other forms of lawful protest available to them. The structures could be replaced if the appeal from the order succeeded. The balance of convenience favoured the City in its bid to enforce a bylaw enacted in the public interest. </summary>
