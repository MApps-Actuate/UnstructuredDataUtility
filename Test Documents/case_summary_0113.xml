<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Appeal by the plaintiff from summary judgment dismissing its action for breach of confidence and breach of fiduciary duty. The appellant purchased a property through a bidding process. Before purchasing the property, the appellant met with a manager of the respondent bank in order to discuss possible financing of purchase. At the time, the appellant indicated to the manager for how much he thought the property could be purchased. When the appellant became aware of a second round of bidding, he increased his offer which was subsequently accepted. Some time later, the appellant learned that the bank manager had participated with others in the bidding process. The appellant alleged that the manager used the information obtained from the appellant to put together a competing bid. The judge found that the claim for breach of confidence could not succeed because the appellant had not adduced any evidence about why and how the purchase price was increased and how the new price was chosen. 	HELD: Appeal allowed. The judge misapprehended the nature of the case being pursued by the appellant and focused solely on the reason for the increased bid. The appellant's case was, however, based on the allegation that the manager misused confidential information. As the judge observed, this issue could not be resolved on a summary trial application. The appellant was denied the opportunity to obtain additional evidence by subpoena or otherwise to support its contention that the manager's conduct led to the second round of bidding. That evidence might have had relevance to both causes of action. </summary>
