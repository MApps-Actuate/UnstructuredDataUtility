<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by the accused Oliver to have section 634(2) of the Criminal Code declared unconstitutional on the ground that his rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms were violated. Pursuant to section 634(2) a person charged with second degree murder was afforded fewer peremptory challenges than a person charged with first degree murder. 	HELD: Application dismissed. The section did not violate the Charter. The difference in parole eligibility for the two offences was sufficient reason to grant different degrees of procedural safeguards. Further, the conviction for first degree murder reflected a greater degree of moral blameworthiness. </summary>
