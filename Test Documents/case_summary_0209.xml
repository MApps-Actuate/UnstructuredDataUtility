<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Applications by accused for certiorari to quash committal to trial order -- Applicants argued there was insufficient evidence at preliminary inquiry to justify committal to trial -- Applicants disputed admissibility of wiretap evidence produced by Crown pursuant to ss. 189(5), 540(7) and 540(8) of Criminal Code as Crown failed to comply with notice requirements -- Applicants charged with conspiracy to traffic in cocaine and conspiracy to traffic in hashish -- As parties could not agree on how preliminary hearing was to proceed, preliminary inquiry judge ordered that hearing proceed pursuant to s. 540(7) -- Although no evidence proved that Notices under s. 189(5) were actually served on applicants, there was clear evidence that they had copies of transcripts and were aware of the discs of the wiretap evidence -- Applicant Steeves was self-represented at preliminary hearing and argued that he was wrongfully ordered to produce a list of witnesses pursuant to s. 536.3 and that preliminary judge lost jurisdiction because he failed to inquire if Steeves wished to call witnesses pursuant to s. 541(4) -- Steeves eventually complied with s. 536.3 requirement to produce witness list -- Other applicants did not produce list -- HELD: Applications dismissed -- Applicants Gallant and LeBlanc did not comply with s. 536.3 to provide a statement identifying the issues, evidence and witnesses -- While there was proof that s. 189(5) Notices were prepared, there was no evidence that they were given to applicants when transcripts of the wiretap and accompanying statements were given -- Ample evidence that applicants had documents and had reviewed them for considerable period of time prior to preliminary hearing -- Applicants required to raise issue of compliance with ss. 189(5) in conformity with s. 536.3 which they failed to do -- Even if matter could now be raised by applicants, no jurisdictional error resulted warranting certiorari order -- Although self-represented, Steeves still had to comply with s. 536.3 -- Although preliminary inquiry judge erred in not asking Steeves if he wanted to call witnesses, judge complied with all other requirements and the procedural error did not cause him to lose jurisdiction. </summary>
