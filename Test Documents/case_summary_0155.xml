<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>In this child protection proceeding, the intended third parties sought to be joined as third parties in the Minister of Family and Community Service's application for guardianship of the two children -- The children's mother did not contest the Minister's application -- The intended third parties were the children's foster parents, with whom the children had been placed since they were first taken into the Minister's care two years earlier -- HELD: The motion was dismissed -- The right of foster parents to bring proceedings for custody and/or adoption ought to be severely limited, if not precluded, until such time as a court had granted guardianship to the Minister -- While a foster parent was put in a most difficult situation, it was essential, if the overall system was to function properly, that foster parents not be in breach of their fiduciary duties to the Minister and society -- A conflict of interest between parents and foster parents had to be guarded against. </summary>
