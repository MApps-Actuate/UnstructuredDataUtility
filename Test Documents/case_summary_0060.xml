<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Action by the plaintiffs, Chinn and Hanrieder, for a declaration that certain mineral rights were held for their benefit in a secret trust. The plaintiffs were siblings and the only children of the deceased and his first wife. The defendant was the deceased's second wife. The deceased held an interest in underground mineral rights. He was told by his lawyer that he could not bequeath the mineral rights in a will due to the manner in which his interest was structured. Earlier drafts of the will and correspondence between the deceased and his lawyer evidenced an intention to bequeath the mineral rights to the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs testified that their father and the wife made a special trip to each of them to confirm his attention. They testified that at the same time, the wife expressly disavowed any interest in the mineral rights, as she had sufficient finances of her own. The plaintiffs claimed that the deceased created a secret trust whereby the wife would hold the mineral rights in trust for their benefit. The wife denied knowledge of any such agreement. Following the passing of the deceased, the wife believed that she held a joint tenancy interest in their condominium based on instructions to their lawyer at the time of purchase. When she went to transfer title, she learned that it was held as tenants in common. She arranged for the law firm to correct the error. The law firm approached the plaintiffs regarding a release on any claim they had in the condominium. The plaintiffs contended that the wife breached an agreement reached with her lawyer whereby she would transfer the mineral rights in return for them delivering executed releases of their interests in the condominium. The wife denied the existence of the agreement. Meanwhile, the mineral rights unexpectedly began producing significant income that went directly to the deceased's wife through a family trust. She testified that the deceased had always wanted her to have the income from the mineral rights. 	HELD: Action allowed. The wife was fully aware that she had authorized her lawyer to obtain a release to the condominium in exchange for the mineral rights. Her evidence at trial contradicted her examination for discovery regarding conversations in her presence between the deceased and the plaintiff regarding the rights. Her evidence contradicted her lawyer's notes regarding her claim to the rights. The wife was not a credible witness and her evidence was rejected. The evidence clearly established that the wife and the deceased agreed that upon his death, she held the mineral rights in trust for the plaintiffs. She breached the agreement to transfer the rights in return for releases of the plaintiffs' claim to the condominium. The plaintiffs were granted an accounting of monies received by the wife on account of the mineral rights, a tracing order, and damages as determined by the accounting. </summary>
