<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Trial of the accused, Brooks, for second degree murder -- The accused and a witness, Mawhinney, gave videotaped statements to police regarding the death of the victim, Palmer -- The witness met the victim over the internet and they agreed to complete the sale of some personal items in person -- After their deal, they purchased alcohol and drank and talked -- The witness said that the victim began to make sexual advances and exposed himself -- The witness asked the victim to drop him off at a bar -- Shortly thereafter, the accused was approached by the victim in his vehicle asking if he wanted to go drinking -- The accused had no place to stay that evening and agreed, but mentioned that he was armed with a rifle -- The accused stated that he drank in the victim's vehicle until sunrise and passed out -- He stated that when he awoke, the victim was trying to perform oral sex upon him -- The accused grabbed his rifle and fired one shot into the car as the victim tried to exit and a second shot as the victim ran -- The second shot struck and killed the victim -- The accused took the vehicle and was apprehended two days later after being pulled over for speeding -- DNA evidence placed the DNA of the accused on the penis of the victim -- At issue was whether the accused had sufficient intent to support a conviction for second degree murder -- HELD: Brooks was not guilty of second degree murder and was convicted of manslaughter -- The assertion by the accused that he awoke to find the victim sexually assaulting him was consistent with the victim's sexually aggressive behaviour described by the witness -- The witness's story was unknown to the accused when he gave his statement -- The statements of the accused did not convince that he was sexually active with the victim -- There was thus reasonable doubt as to what inference could be drawn from the DNA evidence -- The accused acted under provocation, losing self-control after awakening suddenly to discover the victim perpetrating a wrongful act -- It was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had the necessary intent to support a conviction for second degree murder. </summary>
