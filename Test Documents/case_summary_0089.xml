<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Action by the insured for indemnity for fire damage to his 1995 vehicle. The vehicle was burned badly and was considered a total loss. The insurer refused to pay on the ground that the insured made a willfully false statement in respect of the claim. On his claim form, the insured alleged that the vehicle was purchased for $20,000 and had no major repairs since purchase. The vehicle had in fact been purchased for $15,000 and was rebuilt. The insurer alleged the insured wilfully misstated the purchase price and failed to disclose the vehicle's repair history. 	HELD: Action dismissed. Although the insurer did not establish that the insured made a wilfully false statement about the vehicle repairs, his statement about the purchase price was made intentionally and wilfully with knowledge that it was not true. The reported purchase price of a motor vehicle in an insurance claim was a fundamental fact which assisted the insurer was investigating the claim, and in assessing the pay out value of the chattel. Obtaining the accurate purchase price from the insured was highly relevant and material to an insurer in considering a pay out under the claim. </summary>
