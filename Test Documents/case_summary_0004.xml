<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Sentencing of accused after pleaded guilty to possession for the purposes of trafficking in cocaine. The accused was involved in a dial-a-dope scheme. Prior to being pulled over by police, the accused was involved in three apparent transactions. Police found a significant amount of cocaine in the vehicle and a cell phone. During the search, the cell phone rang several times and police were able to make seven further deals. Although there were indications that the accused was involved in trafficking cocaine on more than this occasion, there were also indications that this was a sporadic weekend activity undertaken by the accused at the suggestion of another person. The accused did not profit dramatically or engage in high end transactions and sold drugs to affluent middle class people rather than addicts. He was at the low end of involvement and borrowed a vehicle and cell phone. The accused was 25 years of age at the time of the offence. He expressed remorse and was apparently unaware of the potential effects of crack cocaine. His pre-sentencing report was favourable and he qualified for an electronic monitoring program. He had been on bail without incident. The accused had a supportive network of positive influences and had a productive background with relatively steady employment and school attendance. The acquaintance who persuaded the accused to become involved had been convicted and sentenced to a 12 month conditional sentence. 	HELD: Accused sentenced to a conditional sentence of 12 months with six months house arrest. Accused was an appropriate candidate for a community sentence. The nature of the accused's activities required a denunciatory sentence. Deterrence for this offender and other similar offenders could be achieved through a strict conditional order. </summary>
