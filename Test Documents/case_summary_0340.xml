<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Summary trial of subrogated claim brought by plaintiff's insurer after a motor vehicle accident. The defendants argued the claim could not be sustained as a result of the application of the direct compensation system under s. 263 of the Insurance Act. It was admitted that the defendants were entirely responsible for the accident. The insurer paid out $15,348 under a cargo insurance policy, the cost of the damaged trailer, and it was able to recover $4,210 in salvage. It now sought the difference, $11,138, from the defendants. The insurer of the defendant, Team Logistics, refused to pay the claim because of its view that the trailer did not constitute cargo and should therefore be covered by the direct compensation scheme in s. 263 of the Insurance Act. 	HELD: Judgment issued for $11,138 against the defendants, plus costs of $7,500. The motor vehicle liability policy that the plaintiff had was the Ontario Automobile Policy (OAP 1) that was in force at the time. This policy was approved by the Superintendent of Financial Services for use as the standard owner's policy. It provided that a trailer that was not owned by the owner of the towing vehicle was covered under the towing vehicle's motor vehicle liability policy, but was not covered for direct compensation. It further provided that a trailer that was owned by the insured was covered for direct compensation if it was attached to an automobile of less than a certain weight and if it was not designed or used for living in. The Fleetwood trailer in this case was not owned by the owner of the towing vehicle and it was designed for living in. Thus under the terms of the standard insurance policy, direct compensation was not available for damage to the trailer. The trailer was not covered by direct compensation and the plaintiff's insurer could therefore pursue a subrogated claim. If the trailer fell within the general provision of s. 263(1), it was nonetheless captured by the exception in s. 263(7) and thereby excluded from the direct compensation regime. On reading s. 263(7) as a whole, its purpose was to exclude objects that were being carried for reward from direct compensation. It would not make sense, in this context, for a trailer that was being towed to be treated differently from a trailer that was, for example, being carried on a flat bed or differently from any other cargo that may have been contained within the vehicle. The trailer in this case was being "carried" by the towing vehicle in that it was being transported. </summary>
