<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by Fowler that its mechanics' lien action be continued pursuant to s. 52.1(1)(b) of the Mechanics' Lien Act -- Morrison countered that Fowler was too late and sought a Certificate of Discontinuance of the action issued pursuant to s. 52.1(1) of the Act -- Fowler filed a Claim for Lien on March 23, 2006, against real property owned by Morrison -- In its Claim for Lien, Fowler claimed a lien upon the estate of Mr. Morrison in the Property with respect to the supply of building materials, hardware and labour -- On May 16, 2006, Fowler commenced an action against Morrison -- A Certificate of Pending Litigation was issued on May 19, 2006 -- A Statement of Defence and a Counterclaim were filed by Morrison on September 7, 2006 -- A notice requiring an Affidavit of Documents was filed by Morrison on June 15, 2006 -- No Affidavit of Documents was provided by Fowler Brothers in response -- A new Notice Requiring an Affidavit of Documents on January 8, 2007, along with a letter advising of additional information that Morrison required before moving forward with the action -- No information was provided by Fowler nor was an Affidavit of Documents provided -- Counsel for Morrison wrote to the solicitor for Fowler on April 23, 2007, and warned him that he was running out of time to set this matter down for trial -- The action was not set down for trial within one year from the date of its commencement on May 16, 2006 nor was an application made for an order to continue the action within the one year time period pursuant to s. 52.1(1)(b) -- Fowler had accordingly missed the one year limitation period established by s. 52.1 of the Act -- Approximately $95,000 continued to be held by Morrison's solicitor -- This constituted monies advanced by a bank in respect of the mortgage on the Property obtained by Morrison -- Fowler also sought the following relief in addition to or in the alternative to an order that the action be continued: (i) a declaration that all of the monies currently held by Morrison's solicitor in trust constituted a trust fund in the hands of Morrison for the benefit of Fowler, pursuant to s. 3 of the Act; (ii) a declaration that the funds constituted a constructive trust for the benefit of Fowler; (iii) an order that the funds be preserved in trust pursuant to Rule 35.02 of the New Brunswick Rules of Court; and (iv) an order that the funds be paid into Court pending resolution of this matter -- HELD: Application dismissed, and the action by Fowler discontinued -- The Action was not set down for trial nor was an application made for an order to continue the action within one year after the action was commenced -- Accordingly, it was deemed discontinued -- Morrison was not a builder or contractor or subcontractor as contemplated by s. 3 of the Act and accordingly s. 3 was not applicable to the funds held by his solicitor, and therefore the funds did not constitute a trust pursuant to s. 3 -- Fowlers' constructive trust/unjust enrichment argument failed as they had a clear, legal remedy available, which was to sue on the building contract -- With respect to the application for a preservation order, Fowler had not established the possibility of irreparable harm to it should a Preservation Order not be granted. </summary>
