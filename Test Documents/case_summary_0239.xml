<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Motion by the defendant Seo for an order sealing all documents filed in this proceeding and that they not be part of the public record. The plaintiff TW alleged in this action that Seo sexually assaulted her. As a result of this action, Seo now faced criminal charges for sexual assault, battery and mischief. Seo argued that his defence in the criminal proceedings would be adversely affected if the civil proceedings were part of the public record. 	HELD: Motion dismissed. Seo did not provide sufficient evidence to justify the order being requested. It was not clear from the evidence how his defence to the criminal proceedings would be adversely affected if the civil proceedings were part of the public record. The examinations for discovery were, however, not to be filed in the court until the completion of the criminal proceedings. </summary>
