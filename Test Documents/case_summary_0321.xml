<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Action by the wife for spousal support, division of property and an order setting aside the separation agreement. The parties married in 1997. Each party had been divorced previously. The wife, 44, worked at various office jobs and then delivered mail until she was terminated shortly prior to trial. The husband, 58, was a skilled tradesman earning over $100,000 in recent years. The wife's income was about $25,000. The parties separated in 2004 after 15 years of cohabitation. In 2005 the parties negotiated a separation agreement with the assistance of experienced counsel. The agreement provided for a lump sum payment to the wife of $130,000 representing her interest in the matrimonial home, an equalization payment and a one time lump sum spousal support payment. The wife specifically waived any ongoing spousal support. The payment of $130,000 was reduced by $24,000 on account of the line of credit obtained after the wife's accident. The husband thereafter applied for a simple divorce. The wife argued that her fragile emotional state, exacerbated by her problems with alcohol, left her unable to meaningfully participate in the negotiations, to understand the advice she received from her lawyer or to provide proper instructions to her lawyer at the time the separation agreement was negotiated. 	HELD: Action allowed in part. The portion of the separation agreement dealing with lump sum spousal support and the waiver of ongoing periodic spousal support was set aside and an order for periodic spousal support made retroactive to the date of separation. The provisions for spousal support did not meet the factors to be considered in s. 15.2(4) and the objectives of spousal support found in s. 15.2(6) of the Divorce Act. This was a long term relationship in which the husband was the main breadwinner. The wife was disadvantaged by the breakdown of the marriage and suffered economic hardship as a result of the breakdown of the marriage and the lack of support from the husband. It was unlikely, because of her lack of job skills and her emotional problems, that the wife would achieve a level of self-sufficiency sufficiency that would allow her to enjoy a lifestyle in any way similar to that which she had with the husband and which he continued to enjoy. The matrimonial home was valued at $228,000. After deduction of the mortgage and line of credit, the wife was entitled to receive $72,000 for her interest in the home. She was further entitled to $37,000 as her equalization payment. Considering the wife's need and the husband's ability to pay, he was ordered to pay monthly spousal support of $2,500 from 2004 to 2006. Taking into account the husband's reduction in income, support was reduced to $2,000 per month as of 2006. Assuming the husband retired in December 2007, spousal support would have to be reconsidered. </summary>
