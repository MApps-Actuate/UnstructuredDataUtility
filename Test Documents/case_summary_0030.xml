<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by Lee to exclude evidence from his trial on charges of possession of cocaine and heroin for the purposes of trafficking and possession of the controlled substance MDMA. Police approached a car with its engine running and windows fogged that had been parked for about 20 minutes in Stanley Park. They knocked on the windows and received no response from the two sleeping occupants of the car. Ultimately, Lee, who was in the driver's seat, woke up and, after telling one officer everything was fine and arguing with the officer, got out of the car. His passenger a female, woke shortly thereafter and got out of the car without being asked to do so. The other officer discovered a recently used crack pipe on the passenger's side of the car when the passenger got out. Lee and the passenger were arrested for possession of cocaine. Lee was subjected to a pat-down search by one officer, which yielded a baggie of brown drugs. The officer arrested Lee for possession of heroin but Lee volunteered the drug was MDMA. The passenger told the police Lee had more drugs on him. In Lee's underwear the officers found several baggies containing cocaine and heroin with a total value of $2,400. The officer who first approached the vehicle testified she was concerned for the safety of the occupants, and after removing Lee, was concerned for the well being of the passenger. She conducted the pat-down search out of concern Lee might had weapons. The Crown conceded Lee was detained when he was ordered to get out of his car. 	HELD: Application allowed. The drug evidence obtained on Lee was excluded. The police lacked objectively reasonable grounds to order Lee out of his car. No circumstances existed to give rise to concerns about the safety of the persons in the car. Once Lee woke up and told the officers everything was fine, the officers had no basis to order him out of the car. The discovery of the crack pipe when the passenger got out had nothing to do with Lee's arbitrary detention. The passenger got out by her own choice and the crack pipe was found in plain view. It was not evidence obtained due to a breach of Lee's rights. Lee's arrest for possession of cocaine upon discovery of the crack pipe was not reasonable. The officers did not witness Lee using the pipe and did not observe any behaviour from him that would give rise to a suspicion he had used cocaine. The evidence of drugs found in Lee's possession was obtained in infringement of his rights not to be arbitrarily detained and to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure. The drugs were not conscriptive evidence, so admitting them would not affect trial fairness. The evidence was not obtained in good faith. The breaches of Lee's rights were very serious, considering the pattern of breaches and the intrusive nature of the search to which he was subjected. The offences were not the most serious. There was no reason to believe the drugs would have been discovered but for the violations of Lee's rights. Admitting the evidence would remove a substantial deterrent to police officers acting in ignorance of the rights of the public. </summary>
