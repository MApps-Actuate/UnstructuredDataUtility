<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Motion by the husband for an extension of time to file his factum. The wife sought to have the appeal dismissed as abandoned. The husband had appealed an order increasing spousal support retroactively. He did not file his factum within the time provided under the Rules. The wife refused to consent to the late filing of the factum unless the husband made some payment on account of the arrears. The husband had not made any payments towards the arrears and argued that it would cause him considerable financial hardship to come up with the funds to pay the arrears. 	HELD: Husband's motion allowed. The appeal had merit. The interests of justice were best served by allowing the husband to file his factum. The husband was, however, ordered to pay $100,000 on account of the arrears owing. He was also required to file a letter of credit in the amount of $100,000 to secure the payment of future arrears, and to comply with the support order until the appeal was heard. </summary>
