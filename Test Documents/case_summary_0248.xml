<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by Jones for specific performance of a condominium purchase. Jones agreed to buy a penthouse condominium to be constructed by TWS Developments, and paid a deposit. Jones considered it unique because it had an attractive view and was a trendy redevelopment in a very desirable area. The agreement allowed TWS to set a confirmed occupation date if the condo was substantially completed and a municipal occupancy permit was issued. Either party could terminate the agreement if the confirmed occupation date was not set within 12 months of the date set by the agreement. TWS delayed and made changes to the condominium development. Jones repudiated the agreement and sought return of his deposit. TWS refused to refund and continued to treat Jones as the purchaser. The Condominium Act implied a condition that required TWS to complete the transfer of a unit without unreasonable delay. TWS failed to substantially complete the condominium more than 12 months after the date in the agreement, for causes largely within its control. It had not obtained a municipal occupancy permit. It believed it could never satisfy Jones, purported to terminate the agreement, and refunded the deposit. It relisted the condominium at a higher price. Jones argued that the termination was void, as a confirmed occupation date had never been set by TWS. TWS argued that its termination was valid, and that specific performance was not appropriate, as the condominium was not unique and because of the probability of continuing disputes and protracted litigation with Jones. 	HELD: Application allowed. Specific performance was ordered. Since TWS had not fulfilled the conditions necessary to set a confirmed occupation date, it could not terminate the agreement. In any case, TWS was precluded from taking advantage of its own excessive delay. Jones was entitled by the Act to expect TWS to act with reasonable dispatch. Jones's purported repudiation of the agreement did not preclude him from enforcing its provisions, as TWS did not act on the repudiation. Since the condominium was unique, specific performance was appropriate. The possibility of continuing disputes between the parties did not determine the appropriateness of the remedy. </summary>
