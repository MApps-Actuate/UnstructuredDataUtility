<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Motion by the Children's Aid Society for an order that certain reports and transcripts be admitted into evidence in a child protection trial. The reports and transcripts had been relied on at an earlier trial involving the child's mother and the child's older sibling. The Society also sought the admission of hospital records relating to the sibling. The Society argued that all of the documents related to the past parenting conduct of the mother. 	HELD: Motion dismissed. The evidence was relevant. However, the evidence was already scrutinized and dealt with at the previous trial. Its admission would amount to a relitigation of the issues and could result in inconsistent findings. </summary>
