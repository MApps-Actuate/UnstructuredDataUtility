<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Appeal by Malik et al from the dismissal of their motions to set aside a Mereva injunction and Anton Piller order, to strike certain allegations in the statement of claim and allegations against protected assets, and to consolidate the foreclosure proceedings with a tort action by Malik for malicious prosecution. Among other things, the Mareva injunction restrained Malik from mortgaging or disposing of any of his assets and ordered Malik not to cause Khalsa to mortgage or dispose of any of its assets other than in the ordinary course of business. The foreclosure proceeding was commenced on the following day. The Province initiated an action against the appellants in which it claimed $5,200,131 for debts owed for money advanced to Malik for his defence during the Air India Trial. The appellants were alleged to have conspired to defraud the Province by hiding assets that could have been used to fund the defence. The chambers judge dismissed the applications to set aside the Mareva injunction and the Anton Piller order, and dismissed Malik's applications to consolidate the foreclosure proceeding with the Crown's first action and to stay them pending the hearing of his counterclaim. He held that the Payment Agreement was unrelated to the subject matter of the Crown's first action concerning advances under an earlier, and distinct, agreement, and unrelated to the counterclaim. He also concluded that the security given under the Payment Agreement was not so closely related to the Crown's first action or the counterclaim as to be inextricable from it. He rejected Khalsa's argument that no demand could properly be made on the Guarantee prior to the sale of the Hotel Property. He also rejected Khalsa's alternate argument that the proceeding should be referred to the trial list on the basis there was a triable issue on the point. 	HELD: Appeal dismissed. On the proper interpretation of the Guarantee and the Hotel Mortgage, the Crown was entitled to take steps to enforce payment from Khalsa at any time after the 45th day following the completion of the Air India trial. Khalsa had the option of redeeming the Hotel Mortgage without selling the Hotel Property by paying the Reimbursement Amount to the Crown. Accordingly, the chambers judge did not err when he declined to refer the Crown's foreclosure petition to the trial list. As to the Payment Agreement, the Air India trial was in progress when Malik entered into the Payment Agreement, and its terms were negotiated by counsel for both parties. Malik believed that he was maliciously prosecuted, and would have held that belief when he agreed to pay the Reimbursement Amount without set-off or deduction. Accordingly, it was not inequitable in the circumstances to hold him to his bargain. </summary>
