<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Sentencing of Esmail for conspiracy to smuggle aliens into Canada. Esmail had pleaded guilty to the charges. Esmail was involved in a large-scale, organized scheme to smuggle aliens from India and Pakistan into Canada. The aliens arrived in Canada, and Esmail arranged to smuggle them into the US; Esmail received money from the aliens. The Crown sought a sentence of 12 to 14 months' incarceration; Esmail argued that a conditional sentence would be appropriate. The Crown argued that this was a large, sophisticated and ongoing scheme, and that Esmail's motivation was financial gain. Esmail argued that his role in the overall scheme was a minor one. Esmail had no prior criminal record; he had been married for 20 years and had several children. Esmail provided letters from community members which attested to his good standing in the community. 	HELD: Esmail was sentenced to six months' imprisonment. A conditional sentence was not appropriate. General and specific deterrence were important considerations in sentencing. Smuggling human beings across international borders was an egregious offence which must be taken very seriously. Aggravating factors included Esmail's financial gain, his role in an ongoing, sophisticated operation, and the seriousness of the offence. Mitigating factors included Esmail's lack of criminal record, his stable family life, and his good standing in the community. </summary>
