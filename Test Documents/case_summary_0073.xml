<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Action by Kiraly against the Fuchs for damages for fraud, deceit or negligent misrepresentation relating to his purchase of the Fuchs' home in 2003. Mr. Fuchs was a carpenter and had built the home in 1995, where he lived with his wife until the sale. His wife hit the garage door in 2001 and he repaired the door and some moisture damage he noticed when he was repairing it. His wife was not aware of the moisture problem or repairs. When the Fuchs filled out their disclosure statement, they indicated they were unaware of any problems with the home's structure or of any moisture problems. The Fuchs accepted Kiraly's offer of $326,000 for the purchase of the home. Kiraly commissioned a home inspection. Mr. Fuchs was present during the home inspection and explained to the inspector repairs he planned to undertake with respect to the deck, which was showing signs of rot. He conducted the promised repairs prior to the completion of the sale. Kiraly did not review the inspector's report prior to removing the subject clause. He relied on the disclosure statement. Kiraly separated from his wife shortly after they took possession of the home. He tried to sell it but the first sale fell through when the purchasers found significant signs of water ingress on the deck during a home inspection. Kiraly had the damage to the deck repaired at a cost of $27,132. A subsequent inspection revealed water penetration at the back of the home, so Kiraly spent another $6,705 repairing that damage before he was able to sell the home for $397,000. Friends of Kiraly lived in the home rent-free for six months prior to the completion of the sale. Kiraly claimed the costs of repairs as well as mortgage payments and property taxes from the date of the loss of the first sale to the date of the second, completed sale. 	HELD: Action dismissed. The Fuchs disclosed the defects in the deck to Kiraly's home inspector. These were patent defects but were not actionable because Kiraly failed to act on the inspector's report. The defects to the back of the home were latent. The Fuchs had no knowledge of these defects, so they were not actionable. Kiraly failed to establish he relied upon the inaccurate disclosure statement. </summary>
