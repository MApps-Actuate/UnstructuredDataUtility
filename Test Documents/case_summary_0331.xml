<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Motion by the Crown to admit the videotaped statement given by the accused's son to a police officer. The statement was not made under oath, solemn affirmation or solemn declaration. The accused was charged with incest against his daughter. In his statement to the police, the son said that he saw his father and sister in what he considered to be inappropriate circumstances on two occasions in the family home. On one of the occasions he saw the father having sex with the sister. On cross-examination, the son indicated that his statement to police was inaccurate and that he only made the statement to police in order to help his sister to get their parents' attention. The complainant testified at trial to innumerable acts of incest with her father. 	HELD: Motion dismissed. The circumstances surrounding the taking of the statement did not provide guarantees of reliability. The best that could be said about these circumstances was that the son knew he was giving a statement to a police officer at a police station in the course of an investigation that involved allegations by his sister of incest involving his father. This circumstance was insufficient by itself to bring home to the declarant the importance of giving a truthful statement and the consequences of failing to do so. The statement to police was not strikingly similar to the son's testimony at the preliminary inquiry or to the complainant's testimony at trial. </summary>
