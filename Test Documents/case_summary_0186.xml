<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>The plaintiff K.C. Elliott Ltd. sought damages for the termination of a distributorship agreement, claiming the defendants (manufacturers in the business of the sale and service of heating, ventilation and air conditioning equipment) had breached a territorial franchise agreement by terminating it on 30 days' written notice -- The defendants alleged they had a contractual right to terminate the agreement -- In the first of the two actions, the plaintiffs sought $137,592 allegedly owing for commissions on sales prior to the cancellation of the franchise agreement -- In the second, the defendants sought lost present and future profits and the value of its service business when the franchise agreement was cancelled -- The plaintiffs claimed that the defendants' failure to satisfy their financial obligations in accordance with the agreement constituted a breach of contract, an unjust enrichment to the defendants, and a breach of fiduciary duty to act in good faith in relation to the Plaintiffs -- In the second action, the plaintiffs claimed damages for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, breach of fiduciary duty and interference with economic relations -- Meanwhile, the defendants counterclaimed for damages for breach of contract and special damages as a result of the negligence and breach of contract by the plaintiffs -- HELD: The plaintiffs' action for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, breach of fiduciary duty and interference with economic relations was dismissed without costs -- With respect to the action for commissions, etc., the plaintiff K.C. Elliott Ltd. was awarded judgment against the defendant Trane Canada Inc. for $137,592 less $56,000 for the McCain Argentina settlement for a net amount of $81,592 plus interest, and costs of $6,475 and reasonable disbursements -- The court was satisfied on the evidence that there was no hidden agenda or ulterior motive when Trane terminated the franchise agreement -- The franchise agreement was properly and legally terminated by written notice on Oct. 17, 2001, which termination was effective Nov. 17, 2001 -- The relationship between the plaintiffs and Trane was that of a distributor/ sales agent and a manufacturer -- There was no evidence adduced of improper motive adduced and the defendants did not trigger the default -- The plaintiff's actions caused a breakdown of the mutual trust required for a distributorship agreement -- There was a clear breakdown of trust when the plaintiff company used Trane's funds to finance K.C. Elliott Ltd.'s cash flow because of K.C. Elliott Ltd.'s overdraft with respect to its operating bank account -- The plaintiff company had also breached the agreement by binding the defendants to a contract involving McCain Argentina without the approval of Trane -- Trane did not authorize the McCain Argentina bid -- The plaintiff company was responsible for reimbursement of the $56,000 being its agreed portion of the settlement agreement -- There was no requirement for a cause as condition precedent to terminating the agreement -- The evidence did not establish a fiduciary relationship in the commercial context between the plaintiff company and Trane -- The corresponding deprivation needed to sustain a claim for unjust enrichment did not exist in this case -- The plaintiffs had no ownership interest in the franchise upon receipt of proper notification of termination pursuant to the terms and conditions of the franchise agreement -- The plaintiffs were not induced into any new contract or arrangement as a result of succession planning discussions or the decision to enter contracts -- As for intentional interference with economic relations, the plaintiffs had failed to establish the primary essential element of the tort that the termination of the agreement was unlawful -- On the counterclaim, the plaintiff company breached the agreement by binding Trane to the contract with McCain Argentina, resulting in significant losses -- Trane's claim for $56,000 was allowed -- The counterclaim relative to the Fredericton office building had no merit. </summary>
