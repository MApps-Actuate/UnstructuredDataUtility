<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Sentencing of Casey following his guilty pleas to break and enter, possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking, breach of a peace bond, and breach of bail conditions. Casey smashed the front door of a business, ransacked the place and took $200 in cash and a $300 digital camera. Several months later, Casey was discovered in an alley engaged in a drug exchange. Several bags of marijuana were found in his possession. At the time, Casey was on probation for other offences, a condition of which was that he keep the peace and be of good behaviour. Casey spent some time in custody but was released under the condition he reside at a youth facility. He did so for several months, but failed to abide by a curfew and was returned to custody. Casey was 20 years old and had an extensive criminal record including property-related, drug-related and breach offences. Most of his record was from youth court. He had an unfortunate upbringing characterized by exposure to drug abuse. He started abusing drugs and alcohol at a young age and became involved in the drug culture to support his habit, with the support of his drug-addicted mother. He was also abused as a child and spent three years in custody as a teenager. He obtained a high school education and demonstrated a commitment to continuing his education. He had the support of more stable family members. The Crown sought a global sentence of 12 months' imprisonment, while the defence sought a sentence of time served of five months. 	HELD: Casey was sentence to serve an additional two months' imprisonment. The present offences were not particularly serious and appeared the result of impulsive behaviour. The court considered Casey's background, addiction problems and his plans and goals, but found denunciation and deterrence the paramount sentencing considerations at play. The time Casey spent on remand was sufficient sentence for the break and enter and breach of bail conditions charges. The possession for the purpose of trafficking charge warranted a three-month sentence, reduced to two months for time Casey spent living under strict conditions while on bail. The breach of the peace charge warranted a concurrent one-month sentence. </summary>
