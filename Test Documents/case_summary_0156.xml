<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by Kennedy for directions respecting the form and content of his appeal book. Kennedy appealed from a decision granting HSBC Bank summary judgment against Kennedy for $7,662,807 plus costs of $2,500. Kennedy claimed summary judgment was inappropriate because he had a defence to the action. He did not dispute the amount or costs awarded. Kennedy wanted to include five affidavits, including his affidavit and affidavits from an HSBC bank branch manager and a vice president, the receiver and trustee of Kennedy's business, and another individual. Kennedy did not want to include exhibits with the five affidavits, while HSBC claimed the exhibits were necessary. In addition, HSBC wanted nineteen other affidavits and their exhibits to be included, as well as the ten volumes of HSBC's record on motion for summary judgment. 	HELD: Application allowed. Kennedy was directed to include only the five affidavits he listed in the appeal book. If HSBC was not satisfied the appeal book contained al the relevant and necessary evidence to respond to the appeal, the appeal court could deal with that later. </summary>
