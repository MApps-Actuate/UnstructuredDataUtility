<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>The accused was charged with impaired operation of a motor vehicle and refusing to provide a breath sample -- He applied for a stay of proceedings, claiming that his right to trial within a reasonable time as guaranteed under s. 11(d) of the Charter had been violated -- His first appearance date was December 11, 2003 and the application was brought on December 20, 2006 -- HELD: The application was dismissed -- The delay was constitutionally permissible particularly in the context of there being no prejudice -- Of the three years and nine days, the defence had waived 10 months and 25 days -- There was no delay attributable to the Crown, although institutional delay was 9 months and 29 days -- Overall, the defence actions spoke loudly of the defence satisfaction with the leisurely pace of litigation in this case -- The defence had requested an adjournment on multiple successive occasions, they had conceded waiver to substantial periods of delay, the accused had to be nudged to change counsel from first counsel of choice to reduce delays, and had brought an application for delay just prior to the continuation date when the transcripts could not be prepared in time to be before the court, etc. -- There was very little evidence of prejudice occasioned by the delay in hearing this trial as distinct from prejudice arising from the existence of having been charged with the offences -- The allegations were serious, and the public interest in having a trial on the merits was strong. </summary>
