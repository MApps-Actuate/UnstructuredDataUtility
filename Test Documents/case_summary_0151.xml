<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Trial of Little on three counts of failing to comply with notice served by Minister of National Revenue directing him to file income tax returns and statements of income and expenses for 2000 through 2002 -- Little admitted he did not file required returns and statements deliberately -- Little claimed paying taxes violated his religious freedom as Catholic member of anti-abortion movement -- Little took other steps to ensure his taxes were not used for abortions but these were unsuccessful, so he stopped filing returns -- Claimed use of any portion of his taxes to fund abortions was morally unjustifiable and made him complicit in acts of murder and genocide which went against his religious beliefs and moral compass -- HELD: Little convicted on all counts -- Little failed to demonstrate filing returns actually interfered with his religious beliefs or practices -- Alternatively, any interference with Little's religious freedom resulting from filing tax return was trivial or insubstantial -- Requiring Little to file returns did not discriminate against him on basis of religion -- Requirement to file returns applied to everyone -- Even if filing returns affected Little differently than it did other Canadians, distinction did not make Little out to be person less capable or worthy of recognition or value as human being or member of Canadian society. </summary>
