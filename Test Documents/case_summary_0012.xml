<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Action by wife for divorce, sole custody of children and joint guardianship and spousal and child support. The parties married in 1996 and separated in January 2008. There were three children of the marriage born in 1999, 2003 and 2008. There was a history of violence between the parties, with the husband acting in a physically violent manner toward the wife and damaging the matrimonial home and contents. The parties separated as a result of an incident in which the husband physically assaulted the wife. As a result of the incident, the husband was convicted of assault. The expert who prepared the s. 15 report indicated that the father was more likely to foster a shared custody arrangement than was the mother and that the history of violence between the parties was a result of the marital relationship such that the violence would disappear once the marriage was dissolved. The father had demonstrated inappropriate behaviour since the time of separation. During the marriage, the parties ran a successful martial arts business, the assets of which had been allegedly sold after separation. The husband submitted that is total income was $38,200 per year derived from his work at a marital arts gym and a veteran's pension. However, the husband was unable to explain a number of deposits into his bank account and the indebtedness he claimed for rent of space in a martial arts gym and to his parents did not show on his financial statement. Although the husband claimed to have been hired as the head instructor of the martial arts gym by the purchaser of the gym's assets, the evidence indicated that he played a much larger role in the business than he claimed. The wife was unemployed, having lost her source of income from the martial arts business at the time of separation and was parenting the children full-time. 	HELD: Action allowed. The statutory requirements for a divorce had been met. The plaintiff should have sole custody of the children with joint guardianship. Co-parenting was not appropriate given the history of violence between the parties and the wife's hostility towards the husband. The children had lived with the wife all their lives and there was no evidence of any difficulty in their relationship with the wife. The husband should have access, including overnight access, with the two older children, not no overnight access to the youngest child given her age, that she had always resided with the wife and the fact she was still being breastfed. Income of $43,500 per year was imputed to the husband and he was ordered to pay $869 per month in child support. The husband was to pay to the wife spousal support in the amount of $397 per month. </summary>
