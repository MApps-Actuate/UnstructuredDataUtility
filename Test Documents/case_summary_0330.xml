<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Motion by the husband for a custody and access assessment, sale of the matrimonial home, oral questioning, and disclosure of the wife's medical records. Motion by the wife for interim custody, child support, and interim exclusive possession of the matrimonial home. The parties married in 1991 and separated in 2007 but continued to reside in the same home. They had four children. The wife admitted herself to a psychiatric ward in 2006 where she remained for 25 days. The husband alleged her mental health affected her ability to care for the children. The wife had been the primary caregiver for the children. 	HELD: Husband's motion allowed. The wife's motion was dismissed. There was no evidence that the children were in any danger in the present circumstances. There was no basis to make any order for custody, access, or child support. The husband's request for a custody and access assessment was appropriate in the circumstances. As the parties could not remain in the same home indefinitely, the home should be sold. The wife had 45 days to secure financing to purchase the husband's interest in the home. There was no justification for granting an order for exclusive possession. The parties agreed to oral questioning by each other. It was in the best interest of the children that the wife's medical records be disclosed because they might be relevant to her ability to care for the children. </summary>
