<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Sentencing of the accused for impaired driving and impaired driving causing bodily harm. On the first offence, that accused was stopped by a police roadblock and found to be impaired. The second incident involved a head on collision when the accused's vehicle was traveling at excessive speed after having crossed the centre line. The second offence occurred while the first matter was still outstanding. At the time of the offences, the accused did not have a valid driver's licence. The accused, 51, admitted to being an alcoholic. He had not attended any treatment programs. He had prior drinking and driving convictions as well as convictions for theft and possession of stolen property. 	HELD: The accused was sentenced to 60 days imprisonment for the first offence and to 30 months consecutive for the second offence. He was prohibited from driving for three years. The principles of sentencing which were most important were denunciation and deterrence. The accused presented a substantial risk to re-offend and did not appear to have insight into the nature of his alcoholism. Further, he had not demonstrated sufficient respect for the law to justify taking any such risk on him that would be necessarily involved in imposing a community disposition. </summary>
