<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Action by Hazel &amp; Co. against the Crown, the City of Vancouver, South Coast British Columbia Transportation Authority ("TransLink"), Canada Line Rapid Transit ("CLRT") and InTransit BC for damages for negligent misrepresentation, negligence and nuisance in relation to the construction of the Canada Rapid Transit Line ("Canada Line") on Cambie Street in the City. When operational, the Canada Line was to provide rapid transit connecting downtown Vancouver, the City of Richmond, and the Vancouver International Airport. Hazel &amp; Co. operated a maternity clothing store at 16th Avenue and Cambie Street from 1999 through December 2008. Each of the defendants was involved in the funding, planning, design, construction, operation, and maintenance of the Canada Line. The general public was advised that the Canada Line would be located in a tunnel that would be bored or mined. In fact, the vicinity of 16th Avenue and Cambie Street was affected by cut and cover construction and its related activities from the fall of 2005 through October 2008. Hazel &amp; Co. claimed that it relied on misrepresentations that the Canada Line would be constructed in the vicinity of its business by means of a bored tunnel that would not disturb the street surface before it renewed the lease of the premises and before it ordered or manufactured retail inventory. It further relied on a representation that open trench, cut and cover construction would last no more than three months in front of its premises. It claimed that the defendants breached a duty of care and were negligent in the process of selecting a consortium to design, build, operate and maintain the Canada Line by means of InTransit BC. Hazel &amp; Co. further claimed that the cut and cover method of construction used in the vicinity of its business resulted in an actionable nuisance and caused economic loss. The defendants denied that the method of construction caused a nuisance, but if it did, then it was a public nuisance in respect of which Hazel &amp; Co. could not bring an action without the consent of the Attorney General. Alternatively, the defendants said that if any of them caused a private rather than public nuisance, they could not be liable because they carried out the project under statutory authority and any nuisance that arose was the inevitable consequence of undertaking construction of the Canada Line. 	HELD: Action allowed, in part. TransLink, CLRT and InTransit BC were liable in nuisance, and Hazel &amp; Co. was awarded damages of $600,000 for the business loss occasioned by the nuisance. The misrepresentation and negligence claims against all defendants were dismissed. There was no evidence to support the allegation that the representation made in 2003 with respect to the method of tunnel construction was false or negligent. The representation regarding the expected duration of open trench construction was based on reliable information as it existed in January 2005. The representation became inaccurate when conditions encountered in the course of construction necessitated change. The representation was not untrue, inaccurate, or misleading at the time it was made. There was a sufficient relationship or proximity between the party responsible for the construction of the Canada Line and adjacent property owners or business operators to create a prima facie duty of care. It was readily foreseeable that a failure to exercise reasonable care in the construction of the Canada Line could cause harm to adjacent property owners or occupiers. However, only negligent execution of the selected method of construction could cause actionable harm. No negligence of that kind was alleged. Furthermore, Hazel &amp; Co. did not allege that any defendant caused harm or injury to any person or property. As a result, it could not claim that it incurred any economic loss as a result of harm or injury done to another. The cut and cover construction of the Canada Line tunnel substantially interfered with Hazel &amp; Co.'s use and enjoyment of its premises. The extent of the interference was sufficiently unreasonable to constitute a nuisance. Access to Hazel &amp; Co. was adversely affected by the cut and cover tunnel construction. Parking was eliminated on Cambie Street, and pedestrian crossing was restricted or curtailed. Customers who wanted to find their way to the store were required to find a way to travel to the vicinity of the store, find a place to park at some distance from the store, and make their way to the store on foot over some considerable distance through what was an intensely disruptive construction area encompassing large portions of Cambie Street. As a result, Hazel &amp; Co. experienced a decrease in the number of its customers and had to reduce its staff. It addition, its gross profits declined by approximately 48 per cent. The nature, severity and duration of the impact on Hazel &amp; Co. resulting from cut and cover construction outweighed the social or public utility associated with the creation of the Canada Line to a degree that warranted compensation for nuisance. Cut and cover construction was a private nuisance because it substantially and unreasonably interfered with Hazel &amp; Co.'s use and enjoyment of its leased premises. Even if the statutory power to regulate the use of streets immunized the City from liability, that immunity was not enjoyed by entities such as TransLink, CLRT and InTransit BC, who were using City streets under licence for their own commercial purposes as opposed to general City purposes. The source of the nuisance was the method of construction employed by those responsible for the project. Canada and the Attorney General were government bodies that contributed capital to assist in the creation of an undertaking for general public benefit. As neither was a partner in the legal sense of the word, the claim in nuisance against each of them was dismissed. While the City owned Cambie Street, the evidence did not support that the City knew, or could have been reasonably expected to know, that its property would be used by TransLink, CLRT, and InTransit BC in a manner that would cause a nuisance. The nuisance emanated from the design plan selected by TransLink and CLRT, and carried out by InTransit BC. They were equally responsible for the nuisance they caused, and were jointly and severally liable to Hazel &amp; Co. As there was an alternative method of construction that would not have caused a nuisance in the Cambie Village area, the statutory authority defence failed. Cut and cover construction, and the other construction activities necessitated by it, was the sole cause of Hazel &amp; Co.'s loss. A reasonable assessment of the loss of business income for the period October 2005 through December 31, 2008, caused by cut and cover tunnel construction was $600,000. </summary>
