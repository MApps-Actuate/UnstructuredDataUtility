<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by the accused for the appointment of counsel to represent him with respect to his application to re-open his appeal from conviction and with respect to his sentence appeal. The applicant had been convicted of assault and assault with a weapon by a jury. The applicant had pleaded guilty to several drug offences at the beginning of trial. He was sentenced to a total of 11-and-one-half years' imprisonment, less pre-trial custody served. The applicant's counsel filed a notice of appeal from the assault convictions. The applicant subsequently filed a notice of abandonment signed by his counsel. The applicant now sought to re-open the appeal on the ground that the notice of abandonment was filed without his knowledge or instruction. 	HELD: Application dismissed. The applicant was an intelligent, articulate individual who had a good grasp of the points he wished to make and was responsive to the court's efforts to redirect him when he wandered. With the benefit of the materials filed by the Crown, it would be possible for the court to hear the application to re-open and the sentence appeal on the basis of the materials filed and with the benefit of oral argument at the hearing. This could be done without any unfairness. The applicant was perfectly capable of making his arguments in support of his sentence appeal without assistance. </summary>
