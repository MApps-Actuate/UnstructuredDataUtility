<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>The appellant appealed a conviction for driving while over the legal limit and the subsequent $700 fine a one-year driving prohibition imposed -- The appellant's pick-up truck had been pulled over because the officer in question found it to be excessively noisy -- Noticing a strong smell of alcohol and that the appellant's eyes were red, the officer required the appellant to provide a breath sample by means of an approved screening device, which he failed -- The issue on the appeal was whether the trial judge erred in finding the arresting officer had articulable cause to stop and detain the appellant -- HELD: The appeal was dismissed -- The trial judge had not erred in law in ruling that the officer had articulable cause to stop and detain the appellant -- The officer stopped him because of the excessive noise emitted by his exhaust system and because such was defective -- He specifically mentioned he believed the appellant was committing an offence under s. 235 of the Motor Vehicle Act -- The officer was justified in stopping the appellant in the circumstances -- The decision was well supported by the evidence. </summary>
