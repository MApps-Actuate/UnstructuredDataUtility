<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Action by an inmate against the Attorney General of Canada for general damages of $15,000 and for punitive damages of $10,000 for puncture wounds and abrasions to his upper torso and left arm. The plaintiff was in the outdoor recreation yard for protective custody inmates at the Milhaven Penitentiary, a maximum security facility. He was attacked from behind and stabbed by two inmates. The plaintiff claimed that the prison authorities did not take reasonable steps to prevent inmates from being in possession of dangerous weapons and from entering the yard with them. He argued that the prison authorities knew or ought to have known that there was an increased risk of harm to inmates in the segregation unit, and, as such, were under a duty to search inmates prior to allowing them to associate with others. He further alleged that the defendant failed to provide prompt and adequate treatment to him. Prior to the attack, the plaintiff had had no difficulties with either of the two fellow inmates. The plaintiff admitted that these fellow inmates had never threatened him before. 	HELD: Action dismissed. The stabbing incident took place in a matter of two to three minutes. The response to the attack was appropriate and in accordance with the sound policy of guards not entering the yard. The attack on the plaintiff was a random act of violence from which liability on the part of the defendant could not flow. The defendant was not negligent in failing to assist the plaintiff with psychological assistance or counselling after the stabbing. </summary>
