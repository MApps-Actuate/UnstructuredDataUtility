<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Motion by respondent College for leave to disclose assessor's report to Regional Health Authority prepared by two pathologists -- Motion by intervenor newspapers for removal of publication ban respecting assessor's report and parts of an affidavit of Registrar of College referring to assessor's report -- Menon, a pathologist with Regional Health Authority, suspended from practice of medicine in 2007 -- Review Committee ordered assessment of Menon's practice -- In response to Menon's application for judicial review of suspension, College filed Registrar's affidavit which referred to assessor's report -- Assessor's report and references to report in affidavit found inadmissible at judicial review application and publication ban imposed on report -- Inquiry into complaint against Menon resulted in reinstatement of Menon's licence -- College subsequently sought to release report to Health Authority for purpose of being used in studies or programs for medical education or improvement in medical or hospital care -- Menon refused to consent to release of report -- HELD: Motions allowed -- Publication ban ordered to ensure Menon would not be prejudiced in judicial review application then pending -- After judicial review was complete, this concern was not longer relevant -- No evidence that continuation of publication ban was necessary to prevent serious risk to proper administration of justice -- Release of report not prohibited by Medical Act -- Because Menon worked exclusively for Health Authority, findings and recommendations in report would have a direct impact on quality of service it provided -- Disclosing report to Health Authority was logical and necessary step in administration of Medical Act as it involved regulating practice of medicine and maintaining standards of skill and of practice for practice of medicine -- Report was not a peer assessment. </summary>
