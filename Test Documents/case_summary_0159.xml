<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Motion by the plaintiffs, Doucet and Dauphinee, to strike the statement of defence of the defendants, Spielo Manufacturing and Manship -- On a previous motion, the defendants were ordered to comply with a previous electronic disclosure order, and to provide a further and better affidavit of documents -- The plaintiffs were granted leave to cross-examine the defendants on those affidavits to determine whether adequate disclosure had been made -- The plaintiffs submitted that the defendants still had not met their disclosure obligations -- The plaintiffs argued that the defendants spoiled evidence, abused the court's process, and committed contempt of court -- They submitted that the defendants' conduct deprived them of the prospect of a fair trial such that striking their defence was the only just remedy -- The plaintiffs further sought an award of special costs -- The defendants submitted that the plaintiffs were exploiting interlocutory procedures to prolong and increase the cost of the litigation -- HELD: Motion dismissed -- The evidence did not establish beyond a reasonable doubt, or on a balance of probability, that the defendants were guilty of deliberate non-disclosure or destruction of documentary evidence -- There was not a persistent and flagrant violation of the Rules or a previous order -- It could not be said that the defendants had not attempted to comply with previous orders, as a massive amount of material was disclosed -- Their failure to file a further and better affidavit of documents was not a sufficient basis to strike their defence, as such disclosure was now made in substantial compliance with the Rules -- The plaintiffs' ability to prosecute their claims was not irreparably damaged by the defendants' conduct -- The defendants had a credible defence and striking their pleadings was a disproportionate response -- However, the defendants did not exercise the requisite degree of care and caution needed to meet their disclosure obligations -- Their efforts to search for relevant documents enumerated in the previous order were inadequate -- The plaintiffs were awarded costs of the motion in the amount of $20,000. </summary>
