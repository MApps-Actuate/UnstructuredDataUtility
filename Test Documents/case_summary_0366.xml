<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Appeal by father, a resident of New York state, of a decision to retroactively change child support. The father claimed the court lacked jurisdiction to make a support order based on the mother's failure to employ the procedures set out in the Interjurisdictional Support Orders Act. Alternatively, he alleged judicial errors in imputing income based on the differences in the countries' tax rates, etc. 	HELD: Appeal allowed. The Act was to be complied with when seeking support from a foreign resident in a reciprocating jurisdiction. The court had no jurisdiction. The judgment was set aside without prejudice to the mother's right to proceed under the Act. If the manner of the father's participation in the case before the Ontario Court of Justice was sufficient to amount to attornment to the jurisdiction of the court, it could not confer jurisdiction on the court where none existed. The ISO appeared to provide a comprehensive scheme from dealing with interjurisdictional support orders. Parties could not attorn to the jurisdiction of a court that lacked jurisdiction ab initio. </summary>
