<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by the wife and her company for summary judgment in their claim against the husband and his company for $161,864, representing the amount of tax with wife's company had to pay when the husband's company redeemed shares transferred to the wife's company in the context of a settlement of matrimonial proceedings. When the shares were transferred and redeemed, neither party considered the income tax implications. The redemption gave rise to an obligation on the part of the wife's company to pay taxes of $161,864, with a corresponding refund to the husband's company of $161,864. The settlement agreement involved the division of millions of dollars' worth of assets the parties acquired during their 32-year marriage. 	HELD: Application dismissed. The failure of the parties to consider the income tax implications of the share transfer and redemption was an oversight, not a misinterpretation or misunderstanding that could justify voiding the settlement agreement. Even if the tax consequences were considered a material term of the agreement, the husband did not receive a windfall, and the wife did not suffer a loss. The wife's company was entitled to a refund when it paid dividends to the wife, and the husband's lost the benefit of its refundable divided tax on hand account. Considering the amount of assets divided in the agreement, the amount of the tax payable by the wife's company and refunded to the husband's company was minimal. </summary>
