<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Motion by defendant for leave to amend defence to add counterclaim against plaintiff Doucet and plead termination for cause -- Plaintiffs were employees and shareholders of defendant -- Pursuant to subscription agreement, employees were required to sell their shares back to defendant at net book value upon termination of their employment -- Defendant terminated plaintiffs' employment due to reorganization and paid the calculated net book value of plaintiffs' shares -- About one year later defendant sold to another company at a significantly higher share price -- Plaintiffs commenced present action including claims for oppression, negligent misrepresentation and unjust enrichment -- Defendant alleged it recently learned that plaintiff Doucet was actively involved in affairs of another company, thereby breaching his duty owed to defendant -- Defendant now wished to plead that Doucet was dismissed for cause and counterclaim for the amounts paid to him at his termination -- HELD: Motion allowed -- On the face of proposed amendment and defendant's affidavit, amendment was bona fide -- Defendants ordered to adhere to strict time line to ensure any prejudice to plaintiffs would be minimal -- If trial judge determined that defendant only recently learned of Doucet's involvement in another company, this fact could be used to establish termination for cause. </summary>
