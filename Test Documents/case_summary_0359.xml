<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by the accused for an order that the amendments to s. 258(1)(c) that related to "evidence to the contrary" or "evidence tending to show" and the new s. 258(1)(d.01) of the Criminal Code did not apply to this prosecution. The accused was charged with drinking and driving and argued it would be unfair to deprive him of the Carter defence as it was available prior to the amendments. 	HELD: Application dismissed. The amendments to s. 258(1)(c) and 258(1)(d.01) had retrospective application and applied to trials for offences under section 253(b) of the Code alleged to have been committed prior to July 2, 2008 and where the trial commenced after July 2, 2008. Although the amendments added additional requirements, the defence had no vested right in the Carter defence. </summary>
