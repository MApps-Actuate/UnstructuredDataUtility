<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by the defendant for an order that the amount owing on a mortgage to Towerville Properties could be paid from the proceeds of sale of a property. The defendant purchased a property in 2004. In 2006 he purchased a second property. He then obtained a mortgage from Prime Pacific on both properties. In 2007, the plaintiff filed a Builders lien against the second property. The present action was commenced to enforce the lien. Towerville subsequently agreed to pay Prime Pacific the amount outstanding on its mortgage and obtained an assignment of the mortgage and the assignment of rents. The mortgage and assignment of rents were discharged from the first property in 2008 to assist the defendant to re-finance that property. No money was paid or other consideration given in exchange for the partial discharge. In 2009, the defendant sold the second property. The plaintiff argued that the mortgage did not rank in priority to the lien because when the mortgage was discharged against the first property it was no longer a good faith mortgage. The defendant argued that a lien claimant could not invoke the doctrine of marshalling and that since the mortgage was discharged against the first property, there were no longer "two funds" available, marshalling could not apply. 	HELD: Application allowed. While marshalling would ordinarily be available to the plaintiff was a builders lien claimant, marshalling was not available in this case as the mortgage had been discharged against the first property so that there were not two funds in existence and available at the disposal of the defendant when the question of marshalling arose. The balance owing under mortgage had always been secured in good faith. The question of whether a mortgage was secured in good faith was determined at the time of the advances. Once there wes an initial assessment that a mortgage was secured in good faith, there was no ongoing obligation to act in good faith as there was no obligation or duty owed by Towerville to the plaintiff. Towerville was free to deal with the question of whether or not the mortgage would be discharged from the first property, despite the fact that the lien had already been registered against the second property. It was the choice of Towerville as to which security was to be enforced first. </summary>
