<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Ruling respecting the admissibility of e-mails attached to the wife's affidavit filed in divorce proceedings. The parties were involved in acrimonious divorce proceedings. The wife argued the husband failed to make full financial disclosure. The husband's former girlfriend gave the wife a series of e-mails between the husband and his former lawyer which the wife attached to one of her affidavits. The husband argued the e-mails were inadmissible as they were protected by solicitor and client privilege. 	HELD: The e-mails were privileged and inadmissible. The e-mails disclosed no intent to commit a fraud or mislead the court nor did they show that the husband sought advice about doing anything improper or criminal. The criminal intent exception to solicitor-client privilege did not apply. There were no facts included in the e-mails that the court could not be made aware of by other means. The interest of protecting solicitor-client privilege clearly outweighed any minimal probative value these e-mails might have to the court. The information was disclosed to the wife improperly and without the husband's consent. The husband had no intention to waive solicitor-client privilege, even if he had disclosed the documents to his girlfriend. The wife could not rely on the disclosure to third party exception to admit information obtained by improper means. </summary>
