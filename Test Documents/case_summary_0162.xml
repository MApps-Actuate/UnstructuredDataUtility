<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>In this voir dire in a criminal trial where the accused faced charges of obstruction of justice in a judicial proceeding by the destruction of evidence and being an accessory after the fact to murder, the defence argued that certain of the accused's statements were not admissible at trial as they were not voluntary and were taken in violation of his Charter rights to retain and instruct counsel and to remain silent -- The defence argued the police were manipulative, that the interviews were oppressive, and that the accused's free will was overborne and his right to silence denied -- The defence alleged he was not offered the right to counsel in the manner required by law and his repeated expressions that he wished to exercise his right to counsel were ignored -- HELD: The statements were admissible -- The court was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that all the statements that were sought to be admitted were made voluntarily -- The accused went to the police station voluntarily, of his own free will -- From that first meeting until the time when he gave his final statement 24 hours later it did not appear his cognitive ability was in any way impaired -- He was fed and given an opportunity to sleep approximately 12 hours between the first and second interviews and had no complaints about how he was treated -- There was no evidence of police trickery or threats or promises made by the police -- The police conduct was not oppressive -- As the accused had just exercised the opportunity to consult with counsel, the police had no further obligation to provide further access under these circumstances -- The police had the right to continue to ask questions -- Although the aggressive nature of the questioning during the final portion of the second interview was not nice, it was not sufficient to remove the accused's free will nor did it do so -- The evidence did not support the assertion that he was motivated to talk because of the aggressive ending to the second interview or oppressive circumstances generally -- He voluntarily decided to talk about what happened in his apartment -- His right to silence was not violated -- The right to counsel was explained quite clearly and in a manner that discharged the informational duty -- He understood his right and had a chance to decide what to do -- The right to counsel was not a continuing right. </summary>
