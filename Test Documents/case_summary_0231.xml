<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>The wife appealed an order of a registrar in bankruptcy that her husband had an undivided one-half interest in their matrimonial home which was subject to attachment by the respondent creditor. The applicant and her third husband had lived in the home occupied by the wife during her first two marriages. They sold that home in 1990 and purchased a new residence. Prior to the closing date, the wife and husband entered an agreement stating that since the wife contributed $60,000.00 towards the purchase of that property and the husband made no contribution, he waived his claim to the investment. The husband declared bankruptcy in 1993. Upon a motion by a creditor, the registrar found that the agreement between the applicant and her husband did not create a trust in her favour for the amount of her contribution to the purchase of the property. The registrar reasoned that the agreement was a domestic contract that only governed the rights of the husband and wife. 	HELD: The appeal was allowed. The registrar erred in principle and in law. The parties had created a resulting trust in favour of the wife to the extent of her contribution to the purchase of the home. </summary>
