<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Motion by the plaintiff for an order certifying the proposed class for settlement purposes and approving the settlement. The defendants were distributors of carbonless paper sheets and the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants unlawfully conspire to fix, increase and/or maintain market prices for the paper. The defendants pled guilty and the parties executed a settlement agreement to resolve the action. The defendants consented to certification for the purpose of settlement. 	HELD: Motion allowed. It was plain and obvious that a cause of action existed and that there was an identifiable class with an interest in the resolution of the commonly raised issue. Furthermore, the proposed class definition provided objective criteria for identifying class members and the proposed representative plaintiff was able to provide adequate representation to the class and had no conflict of interest. As a result, the action was certified as a class action against the defendants for settlement purposes. The settlement was reached through arm's-length bargaining and with expert advice and assistance. Also, the settlement was fair and reasonable and in the best interest of the class. Therefore, the settlement was approved. </summary>
