<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Motion by the representative plaintiff Voutour to add his spouse as a plaintiff to the class action against the defendant Pfizer Canada. The action was for negligence, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of warranty relating to the defendant's drug Bextra. The drug was an analgesic and anti-inflammatory for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis; the plaintiffs claimed that it caused adverse heart symptoms including heart attacks, strokes, and hypertension. The statement of claim included persons who had taken the drug and also their family members. Voutour sought to add his wife as representative plaintiff of the family class. The defendant opposed the motion, arguing that the proposed plaintiff's claims were statute-barred and that leave to add her as a party was required. 	HELD: Motion allowed. Leave was required to add the party as a plaintiff. The proposed plaintiff's claim was not statute-barred because of the operation of s. 28 of the Class Proceedings Act, which suspended the limitations period. Further, the defendant had not established that granting leave would result in non-compensable prejudice to it. Here the failure to name a representative plaintiff of the family class was inadvertent and leave to add the proposed plaintiff was granted. </summary>
