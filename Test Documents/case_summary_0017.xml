<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by the respondents for directions as to whether Holland required leave to appeal from the dismissal of his motion for an adjournment of the respondents' application for a summary trial of his medical malpractice action. The respondents subsequently obtained an order that disposed of Holland's action in a summary trial. Holland was born in April 1987. The respondents were physicians overseeing his birth. When Holland was 17 years old, his mother brought an action on behalf of herself and Holland for damages based on injuries Holland allegedly sustained during his birth. She claimed that those injuries were caused by the respondents' negligence and resulted in Holland's suffering from attention deficit disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiance disorder and brain damage. The respondents argued that the order was an interlocutory order and therefore Holland required leave to appeal. 	HELD: Application allowed and leave to appeal denied. The granting of an adjournment was a matter of practice or procedure. It addressed the administrative timing of the trial of an action. If an order fell within the definition of an interlocutory order under s. 79(1)(b) of the Court of Appeal Act, it was not necessary to decide whether it was final or interlocutory in effect. Therefore, leave to appeal was required. The order was incidental to the principle object of the action. It did not finally dispose of the substantive rights of the parties in the action. Therefore, the order was clearly interlocutory, for which leave to appeal was required. </summary>
