<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by Botha for leave to appeal from the dismissal of his application for an order compelling the Director of the Securities Commission to disclose information gathered pursuant to an investigation of Botha by the Commission. Botha had been investigated for possible violations of the Securities Act. No formal allegations were made against him and no hearing notice was issued. Botha applied for disclosure of the information obtained pursuant to the investigation, claiming the investigators violated his rights by obtaining financial records relating to his family and friends, contacting his family and friends directly and questioning them about matters relevant to the investigation on unlisted telephone lines, and accessing trading accounts of Botha, his friends and family. He was unable to specify which of his rights had been violated or how they were violated. He submitted he was making the application in anticipation of an application for relief. The Commission rejected his application, stating it was both premature and lacked substantive grounds. 	HELD: Application dismissed. The court would be unlikely to interfere with the Commission's decision because no formal proceedings had been taken against Botha and no evidence was adduced to support his allegations that his rights had been breached. There was no question of general importance and no benefit to be derived from his appeal. </summary>
