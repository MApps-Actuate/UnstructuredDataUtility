<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by the Children's Aid Society of London and Middlesex for an order that three children be made wards of the Crown. The children were aged 12, seven, and three. DV was the mother of all three children, and DP was the father of the youngest child. The children had lived together with a foster family for the previous 37 months. The foster parents were committed to the long term foster care of the children, and they did not wish to adopt the children. Since February 1998, the Society had supervised weekly access by the mother to the two younger children. The father of the youngest child had also exercised only supervised access. The oldest child had refused to visit with his mother since late 1998, but the child's counsel claimed that he wished to re-establish contact with his mother in the future. Evidence indicated that the children appeared to have benefitted from the supervised contact. At issue was whether the parents should have been granted access to the children notwithstanding the making of an order for Crown wardship. The position of all parties was that the presumption against allowing access upon the making of an order for Crown wardship had been rebutted. 	HELD: Application allowed. The three children were made wards of the Crown. The mother was allowed to exercise access with the children six times per year, for at least three hours, at a supervised access facility. The mother was also entitled to receive telephone calls from the children, and to have access to report cards, school information, and notices of extracurricular activities. The father of the youngest child was allowed to exercise access with his child twice per year, for at least three hours, in a supervised access facility. He was also entitled to have access to his child's report cards and school information. The children's special circumstances, which justified the access order, flowed from their regular and frequent contact with the mother during 37 months of Society wardship. While some contact would have allowed the children to preserve their memory of their natural parents, the legislated goal of reunification of the original family was supplanted by the Crown wardship order. Only the well-being and stability of the children in the security of their permanent placement was relevant. </summary>
