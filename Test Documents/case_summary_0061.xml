<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by Kelly and Carson for leave to appeal from, and a stay of, decisions by their residential co-operative which had been upheld by the court. The membership of Kelly and Carson in the co-operative was terminated after the Board of Directors convened a meeting to consider a number of complaints brought by other members against Kelly and Carson. A meeting of the membership was held to review the decision, at which time the decision was confirmed. The court dismissed an appeal by Kelly and Carson, rejecting their assertions that the co-operative had failed to observe the principles of natural justice and that its decision was not reasonably supported by the facts. Kelly and Carson no longer lived in the co-operative at the time their application was heard. They alleged several errors on the part of the judge and submitted their appeal was important as a means by way they could restore their good reputations and ensure other co-operative boards were held to the proper standard in dealing with their members. 	HELD: Application for leave to appeal dismissed. Because Kelly and Carson had already moved out of the co-operative, there was no reason to grant a stay. The appeal lacked merit as it was clear the judge considered all the evidence before the court in concluding that the Board acted in accord with the principles of natural justice, and made a fact-based decision. Even if an appeal was allowed, it was unlikely the court would deal with any of the allegations against Kelly and Carson. There was no question of general importance raised to warrant grating leave. </summary>
