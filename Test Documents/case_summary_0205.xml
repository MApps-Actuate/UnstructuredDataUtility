<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by the Minister of Family and Community Services for permanent guardianship of the two-year-old child in question. The mother opposed the application, claiming that with the help of family and friends she was able to look after the child. The father supported the Minister's application, as did the child's lawyers. The 21-year-old mother was mentally challenged and relied on her family for her basic needs. The child was doing well in the foster home where he had resided since his birth. 	HELD: Application allowed. The guardianship order issued with no access rights for the mother. After 18 months of hands-on training, the mother was still unable to adequately parent a child on her own. Past practice suggested her limited cognitive abilities were such that she could not ensure the child's mental, emotional and physical well-being would be maintained and would continue to progress if the child was returned to her care. The Minister's plans were superior and less risky. The mother could not ensure the security and safety to which the child was entitled. It was in the child's best interests that a guardianship order issue. Reserving a right of access to the mother was not in the child's best interests. </summary>
