<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Accused charged with wilfully and without lawful excuse killing a dog kept for a lawful purpose. It was alleged that he had stomped forcefully on the small dog twice, and then picked it up and threw it to the ground. It was not contested that a dog was killed on May 28, 2007 but the accused, citing his alcohol consumption that day and his heavily-intoxicated state, denied any recollection of having killed a dog or of having intended to do so. A key issue was whether the offence was an offence of general or specific intent. 	HELD: Accused guilty as charged. The evidence satisfied the court beyond a reasonable doubt that the dog was not a stray, that a Ms. Pete was the keeper of the dog and that she exercised the control over it that an owner would exercise. As there was no evidence she kept the dog for an unlawful purpose, the dog was "kept for a lawful purpose" for the purposes of s. 445(a) of the Criminal Code. The Crown's evidence regarding the basic fact of the accused's killing of the dog stood essentially uncontradicted. The accused had admitted he could have been at the scene of the incident and that he could have subjected the dog to violent treatment. Although the court accepted he was heavily intoxicated, it did not believe he consumed as much alcohol as he claimed, nor that he was grossly impaired to the point of behaving in effect as an automaton. The overall picture of his functioning bespoke presence of mind, planned and purposeful behaviour and a much greater command of his faculties than he admitted to on the stand. Although he might not have a clear memory of what he did that day, it did not mean he didn't know what he was doing when he did it. His testimony did not raise a reasonable doubt that, notwithstanding his heavy intoxication, his mind was the controlling agency of his voluntary actions when he killed the dog. His degree of impairment, while significant, was insufficient to rob him of his ability to carry out, at the very least, a voluntary willed act. This level of intoxication was insufficient to deprive him of the minimal intent required for conviction of a general intent offence. Based on the jurisprudence, section 445(a) of the Code created a general intent offence. The s. 429(1) introduction of recklessness did not "add an extra mental element" but rather it subtracted one. It removed any need that might perhaps otherwise be thought to exist for proof in a Part XI offence that the accused actually knew or foresaw that his or her actions would cause a particular event. Section 429(1) thus enabled conviction on the strength of proof, without more, of the voluntary performance by the accused of actions constituting an actus reus which actions would "probably cause the occurrence of the event". Accordingly, and applying the jurisprudence, the court concluded that s. 445(a) created an offence of general intent that could not be defended by recourse to evidence of intoxication at the advanced level. </summary>
