<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Trial of the accused charged with failing to comply with a breath sample demand. The police noticed a vehicle on the side of the road in which both the front seats were reclined and on which two males were sleeping. The officer woke up the driver and noted an odour of alcohol on his breath. The officer made a roadside breath sample demand. The accused made 11 attempts to blow into the device but was unable to provide a suitable sample. The officer testified that the accused opened his mouth, thereby breaking the seal on the side of the mouthpiece. After numerous failed attempts, the accused was charged. The accused argued he did his best to follow the officer's instructions and to provide a proper sample. The accused continued to ask for another chance to provide a sample, even after he was charged. 	HELD: The accused was acquitted. The court accepted the accused's evidence as well as that of the officers. Given the conflicting evidence, the court could not say whether or not the accused feigned attempts to provide a sufficient breath sample. </summary>
