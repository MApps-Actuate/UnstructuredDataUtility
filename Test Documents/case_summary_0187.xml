<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>The 38-year-old plaintiff, a professional golfer, sought damages, including aggravated damages, for wrongful dismissal from his employment with the defendant golf club as head golf professional in 2007 -- He had worked each April to October for the plaintiff during each golf season since 2003 -- The defendant argued they had dismissed the plaintiff for cause, as there were deficiencies in his performance in the 2005 and 2006 seasons, but abandoned this argument during its closing arguments -- HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $32,004 plus interest, $2,250 in party and party costs, and disbursements -- Quite apart from the admission that it had not dismissed the plaintiff for just cause, based on the evidence, the defendant had not established just cause for dismissal -- The plaintiff had appropriately mitigated his loss by accepting the teaching position in P.E.I., as at the time there was no reason to believe this would not be a financially attractive position -- Had the plaintiff been employed with the defendant during the 2007 season, he would have earned $33,724, but he had earned $3,000 on his own, he was entitled to a net award of $30,724 -- As the defendant had maintained an untenable position that had the potential for damaging the plaintiff's reputation for as long as it had, an additional four weeks' salary was awarded, resulting in an additional $1,280 for lack of good faith. </summary>
