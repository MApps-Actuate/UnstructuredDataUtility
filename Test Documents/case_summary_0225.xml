<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by landlord under the Landlord and Tenant Act. The application had as its basis three separate notices which were given to the tenants under section 107 of the Act. The three notices were all expressed to be effective on a date earlier than the 120th day after their service. In response to the tenants' preliminary objection to the application, the Landlord argued that the requirement of 120 days only applies to notices which have as their foundation, paragraphs (a), (c), (d) or (e). 	HELD: Application dismissed. The notices provided did not meet the requirements of section 107 insofar as the notice period was concerned. In all cases of notices provided under the section, the required notice is at least 120 days. The entire scheme of that section supports that interpretation of the notice requirements of section 170(1). </summary>
