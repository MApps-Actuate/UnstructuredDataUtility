<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by trustee in bankruptcy for an order that the bankrupt deliver answers in writing to questions, be examined on his written answers and that he remain in custody. In July 2005, the bankrupt filed a notice of intention to make a proposal naming the trustee as trustee in bankruptcy. On application, the trustee was appointed receiver of the assets of the bankrupt as well as the receiver of a number of companies in which the bankrupt had a controlling interest. The bankrupt filed his proposal in August 2005 and the bankrupt's creditors were to vote on the proposal in September 2005. Prior to the meeting, the bankrupt moved to Seattle, Washington and he did not attend the meeting. The creditors did not accept the proposal and as a result the bankrupt was deemed to have made an assignment into bankruptcy. An order was issued for the arrest of the bankrupt and the bankrupt was also ordered to immediately deliver all property that had been identified as being removed from his residence in British Columbia. The bankrupt was examined in October 2007 before the bankruptcy court in Seattle, Washington and as a result of an extradition request on alleged fraud arising out of the business transactions of the bankrupt, he was taken into custody and returned to Canada. Upon his return to Canada, the bankrupt was arrested on an outstanding warrant relating to the criminal charges against him as well as pursuant to the warrant issued under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. The trustee submitted that the bankrupt should be further examined on a number of matters including that he had sufficient funds to travel extensively after relocating to Seattle, he appeared to have received gifts from various creditors, his bank records reflected that over $500,000 was deposited by him once he was in Seattle and about a property he might own in Jamaica. 	HELD: Application allowed. The further examination of the bankrupt should proceed. The objections of the bankrupt were without merit. A number of questions remained unanswered and the trustee was obligated on behalf of the creditors to pursue potential recoveries after obtaining answers to questions posed but not answered. The inherent jurisdiction of the court allowed for a procedure in which the bankrupt answered questions in writing prior to his examination. </summary>
