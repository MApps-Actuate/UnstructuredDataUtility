<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by accused for bail. The accused was a youth who was charged with assaulting his mother, threatening his mother with death or bodily harm and mischief. One evening, the accused struck his mother on her head while she was sitting at a personal computer. Shortly thereafter he picked up a knife, made gestures at or near the mother and suggested he might kill her. A few days later, the accused again threatened his mother to cause her death or bodily harm. He insisted that he be given the family car and when she refused he became angry and threw a telephone, breaking it, and kicked a door. That same day, the accused damaged a cellular phone and closet for which he was charged with mischief. Police were advised by the mother of the accused that the accused had in the past threatened to kill both his mother and his father and that he had violent tendencies. Nevertheless, the mother wished the son to return home to live with her. At an earlier bail hearing the accused was released on a recognizance of bail with various conditions which included that he not attend at his parents' home and that he not consume alcohol. The accused had breached his bail order on four separate occasions by either attending his parents' home or by being found to have consumed alcohol, which resulted in his bail having been amended and a curfew imposed. Shortly thereafter the accused was arrested for impaired driving. He was found after his curfew driving his parents' vehicle and one of his passengers had been shooting a BB gun at people. The next day, the accused was found slumped over the wheel of a vehicle with the keys in his hand and smelled significantly of alcohol. Since the accused was initially released on bail, he had been residing with his sister and all four breaches of bail occurred while he was living with her. 	HELD: Application dismissed. The conduct of the accused, if established in court, amounted to a violent offence and as such the court was not constrained by the presumption against detention. The detention of the accused was necessary for the protection of safety of the public as there was a substantial likelihood of the commission of an offence or the interference with the administration of justice. The court had no confidence in the ability of the accused's sister to ensure the accused adhered to his bail conditions having regard to the historical conduct. The accused was indifferent to the safety of the public and his conduct placed other members of the public at risk. </summary>
