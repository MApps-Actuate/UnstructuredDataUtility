<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application for a review of the minutes of settlement in a matrimonial dispute. The defendant husband sought a review of child and spousal support and the proportionate share of extraordinary expenses. The plaintiff wife sought a review of the support provisions and the parenting schedule. The defendant alleged that the plaintiff had not taken steps to satisfy her undertaking to become economically self-sufficient. The defendant argued that the plaintiff was no longer entitled to spousal support and that child support should be reduced. The plaintiff argued that the defendant breached the settlement by unilaterally ceasing spousal support and reducing child support. The plaintiff also asserted that the defendant's lump sum payment of Workers' Compensation benefits should be included in the calculation of his income. 	HELD: Application allowed in part. The plaintiff did not breach her undertaking. She pursued a career plan in real estate and worked at three jobs while doing so. The defendant's unilateral decision to cease spousal support and reduce child support was a factor in preventing the plaintiff from becoming self-sufficient. The defendant's Compensation benefits were considered as income. The defendant was ordered to continue paying child support in accordance with the minutes of settlement. The plaintiff was entitled to continue receiving spousal support according to the settlement. The parties were ordered to share the extraordinary expenses in proportion to their incomes. There was no evidence that it was in the children's best interests to change the parenting schedule. </summary>
