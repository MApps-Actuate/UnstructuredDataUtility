<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Motion by the defendants, St. Andrew's College and Bradley, for an order dismissing the proposed class proceeding of the plaintiff, WA, for failure to satisfy a costs award. The plaintiff was the proposed representative in a class proceeding. WA alleged that he and members of the proposed class were sexually abused by Bradley, a teacher at the College between 1951 and 1964. His mother, VA, claimed under the Family Law Act. The claim was issued in April 2005. The College advised that they would oppose the motion for certification on the basis that WA was not a suitable representative plaintiff. Counsel for the plaintiffs indicated that they would seek addition or substitution of PM, a non-resident of Ontario, as representative plaintiff on the condition that he would not be exposed to an order for security for costs. The College conducted a de bene esse examination of Bradley, who was 87 years of age. PM was permitted to be added or substituted as representative plaintiff, but an order for costs immunity was refused. The College's costs were fixed at $20,000 and a deadline was set for payment. The deadline passed and the College sought dismissal of the action. The plaintiffs sought an adjournment on the basis that WA was aware of the costs award and intended to settle the award within weeks. Counsel deposed that recent efforts to contact WA were unsuccessful. The record further showed that WA his mother VA, were the subject of numerous outstanding costs awards and writs of executions totaling over $165,000, and dating back 14 to 17 years. Bradley denied the allegations and was acquitted of all charges in criminal proceedings. 	HELD: Motion allowed. The record established that WA and VA were entirely indifferent to costs sanctions. There was no reasonable prospect that WA would pay the costs award despite advice from his counsel. There was no reason to grant him the indulgence of an adjournment. No other known potential student class members were prepared to act as representative plaintiff. The action was dismissed, with a deadline set for other known members to commence an action against the defendants. </summary>
