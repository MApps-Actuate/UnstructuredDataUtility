<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Appeal by the Crown on stay of prosecution for unreasonable delay. Thomas had been charged with having over 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood while operating a motor vehicle. Thomas had been charged on June 10, 2006. Crown disclosure had been completed on December 20, 2006, and a trial date was set on March 2007 for November 29, 2007, a total elapses time of 17 and a half months. Thomas brought an application under s. 11(b) of the Charter for a stay of proceedings because of unreasonable delay. The trial judge found that 13.5 months of the total delay was attributable to institutional and Crown delay and thus Thomas' right to be tried within a reasonable time had been infringed. The Crown argued that the judge erred in the calculation of the inherent time requirements and in his assessment of prejudice. 	HELD: Appeal allowed. The appeal turned on the five months that the Crown took to provide the defence with an audio tape of the relevant police communications. The trial judge had erred in attributing the entirety of the five months delay to the Crown. The period of time fairly attributable to Crown delay was two and a half months, which lowered the total time period attributable to institutional and Crown delay to 11 months. A guideline of eight to ten months was generally used to assess institutional delay, but deviation of several months could be justified in the absence of prejudice. An accused who claimed to be suffering special prejudice affecting his health because of delay bore the burden of bringing the evidence to the attention of the Court. In none of the 13 court appearances had the Court ever been advised by defence of any special prejudice that was being suffered by Thomas because of delay in the proceedings. </summary>
