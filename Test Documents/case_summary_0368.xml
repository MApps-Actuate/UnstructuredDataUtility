<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by Jeremiah for judicial review of decision by Ontario Human Rights Commission. Jeremiah had been charged with uttering a threat to cause bodily harm, but the charges were dropped a year later. Jeremiah commenced a civil action against the police, claiming that there had no reasonable grounds for charging her, and that the police had been improperly motivated by her race. Jeremiah filed a complaint in August 2003 against the police with the Ontario Human Rights Commission, alleging discrimination in the provision of services because of her race and colour. She also alleged that the police commissioner had called a press conference to deflect media attention from her civil action. The commission decided not to deal with the complaint because the crux of the complaint related to matters that occurred when the criminal charges were laid in 2002, and the commission was not satisfied that the delay in filing was incurred in good faith. Jeremiah sought reconsideration of the decision, which was denied by the Commission in April 2006. The Commission claimed that Jeremiah had established no reason as to why she had not filed within the six-month timeframe. Jeremiah applied for judicial review of the Commission's decision in October 2007, 18 months after the reconsideration decision. 	HELD: Application dismissed. The standard of review of decisions of the Commission was that of reasonableness. Jeremiah's complaint as to the press conference of the police commissioner did not fall within any of the headings upon which the Commission's jurisdiction to investigate a complaint was founded. Nothing had been said in the press conference that related to the merits of Jeremiah's case. There had been nothing preventing Jeremiah from filing her complaint while the criminal charge was pending, and she did not prove that her delay was incurred in good faith. The delay in bringing the judicial review application was both inordinate and not adequately explained. Even if there had been any merit to the application for judicial review, it would have been denied because of the inordinate delay in bringing the application and because there would have been no useful purpose served by granting the relief sought. </summary>
