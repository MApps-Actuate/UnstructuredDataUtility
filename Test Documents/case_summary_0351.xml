<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Appeal by Rannala and Randma from a decision ordering the removal of Blaney McMurtry as solicitors of record for them in their action claiming the remaining purchase price owing under an April 2005 agreement. Rannala and Randma represented the vendors of the shares of a business. After the transaction closed, the purchaser Ontario corporation was continued in Alberta and amalgamated with the purchased business. The resulting company counterclaimed against Rannala and Randma for breach of representation, as it discovered they knew about the possible kick-back activities of an employee prior to the transaction but did not inform the purchaser. Rannala and Randma had consulted their solicitor at Blaney when they discovered the employee's activities but were advised the evidence was not hard enough to act upon, so no disclosure of the information about the employee was made. The resulting company conducted its own investigation of the employee and his employment was terminated. In making the order appealed from, the Master concluded there was a risk the information provided by the purchased business, Rannala and Randma to Blaney could be used to the prejudice of the corporation on their defence to the counterclaim. He considered the purchased business involved in the assertion of the counterclaim as it had been subsumed into the resulting company. 	HELD: Appeal allowed. There was no confidential information at issue, given that the resulting company had conducted its own investigation and terminated the employee. The legal opinion provided by Blaney was not relevant to the issue of the knowledge of Rannala and Randma of the employee's conduct. If it became necessary to call the Blaney lawyer at trial, the company had leave to seek an order removing the solicitors from the record at that time. </summary>
