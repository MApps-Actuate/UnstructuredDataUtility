<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Appeal by Jacob Pett from the quantum of damages awarded for future income loss in his action against his father David for personal injuries. The action related to a 2003 motor vehicle accident. David was driving a pickup truck and Jacob was a passenger when David lost control of the truck. It slid off the road and rolled over several times before it came to rest in a field. Jacob initially suffered a concussion from which he recovered, but back pain which arose shortly thereafter persisted to the date of trial. Jacob was a teenager at the beginning of his working career when the accident took place. At the time of trial, he lived with his parents. He lacked a high school education but was a hard worker in his extended family's construction businesses. In the years before and after the accident, Jacob earned between $11,000 and $20,000. Medical evidence adduced at trial suggested Jacob would be limited in his employability in any heavy construction-type job, and that a sedentary job might not be appropriate for him either. Actuarial evidence pointed to a loss of income over the course of Jacob's life of between $300,000 and $470,000. The actuaries assumed someone in Jacob's chosen field would earn about $32,000 per year if healthy. The judge found Jacob was a person who worked through his pain but that he would not be able to continue to perform heavy labour indefinitely because of his back problems. He found Jacob's limited education was also a factor which would limit the job prospects open to him, a factor for which David was not responsible. He awarded Jacob $120,000 in damages for future income loss in addition to other damages. 	HELD: Appeal allowed. The judge failed to adequately explain how he arrived at the figure for future income loss. Given the actuarial and medical evidence before the court, the award of $120,000 appeared unduly modest. Jacob's positive work ethic suggested he might have done better than the average construction worker had be not been injured, but it also suggested he might do better than someone else similarly injured. The lower figure of $300,000 was discounted by $75,000 to take into account Jacob's work ethic, resulting in an award of $225,000 for future income loss. </summary>
