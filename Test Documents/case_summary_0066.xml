<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Appeal by Kartsonas from an order appointing his children as co-committees of his estate. The children claimed that Kartsonas was being unduly influenced by his sister and her daughter. The petitioners relied on the affidavits of two geriatric psychiatrists, Dr. Rabheru and Dr. McDonald. In his affidavit Dr. Rabheru stated that Kartsonas was incapable of managing his affairs due to dementia. Dr. McDonald deposed that Kartsonas had not significantly changed since Dr. Rabheru had found him financially incapable. The affidavits of Drs. Rabheru and McDonald did not give an opinion as to whether Kartsonas was capable of managing himself. The chambers judge was satisfied that Kartsonas was incapable of managing his affairs even though the affidavits of Drs. Rabheru and McDonald did not provide the opinion that he was incapable of managing himself. 	HELD: Appeal allowed and order set aside. An assessment of Kartsonas was ordered. Given the very serious nature of a committeeship order, it was not appropriate to grant, nor did the Act permit the court to grant, an order of committeeship on the basis of ambiguous or unclear medical opinions, or opinions that were not up to date. </summary>
