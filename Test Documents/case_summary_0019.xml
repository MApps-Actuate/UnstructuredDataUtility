<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Action by Dimopoulos against Thiessen for personal injuries he sustained when Thiessen hit him in the face with his hockey stick during a ball hockey game. The incident occurred during a playoff game between two A level teams. Play was intense at this level. Both parties had been involved with the sport for a number of years and were considered excellent players. The league required all players to sign a waiver acknowledging the risks inherent in paying hockey. Dimopoulos claimed he had his stick on the ground and was preparing to check Thiessen when Thiessen raised his stick and contacted with Dimopoulos's mouth, breaking several of his teeth and requiring expensive and extensive dental work. Dimopoulos claimed Thiessen offered no apology. Brugger, a teammate of Dimopoulos, gave a similar description of the incident. Strumecki, a friend of Dimopoulos's attending the game, also gave a similar account and noted that there was no need for Thiessen to bring his stick up. Thiessen testified he had just passed the ball when he noticed Dimopoulos coming up on his right. He claimed he raised his stick in a defensive manner involuntarily, causing it to strike Dimopoulos in the mouth. Allen, a referee, corroborated Thiessen's claim that he raised his stick defensively, not aggressively. The referee gave Thiessen a five-minute penalty, and testified he would have imposed a more serious penalty had he considered the injury to Dimopoulos intentional. Alm, a teammate of Thiessen, also testified Thiessen's action was reactive and in defence. 	HELD: Action dismissed. All the witnesses were considered credible. The court gave the most weight to the evidence from the referee because he was not clouded by personal interest, physical pain or animus. Dimopoulos did not have to establish Thiessen intended to injure him, but he did have to establish his conduct was negligent. Dimopoulos assumed the risk that he could be injured playing hockey. </summary>
