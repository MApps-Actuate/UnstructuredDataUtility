<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>This was a motion for summary judgment by the Children's Aid Society of Toronto. The Society sought a finding that the child was in need of protection and that he be placed in the care and custody of his grandparents subject to Society supervision without access to the father. The father was not represented by counsel. From infancy, the child had lived with the grandparents. By court order, the grandparents and the father had joint custody with primary residence with the grandparents. On July 5, 2001, the father and the grandparents entered into a temporary care agreement as a result of difficulties with the child. As a result of the child's allegations of sexual abuse by the father, on August 8, 2001, the Society brought a protection application and the child was placed in the temporary care and custody of the Society with supervised access to the father and access to the grandparents. In August 2001, a psychological assessment recommended that contact between the child and the father be terminated and his access was suspended. The assessment also concluded that the child felt close to his grandparents and wished to live with them but did not want to have any contact with the father. In December 2001, an order was made returning the child to the temporary care and custody of the grandparents. The father did not submit a plan of care for the child but filed extensive material making serious allegations against the Society and the grandparents. 	HELD: Motion allowed. The father's evidence was reviewed and considered as if it was a plan of care. Self-serving statements and mere allegations were not sufficient to rebut a case for summary judgment. The child needed the stability that could be provided by his grandparents. It was clear and uncontradicted on the evidence that the child needed to be with his grandparents and that ongoing contact with the father would be damaging. </summary>
