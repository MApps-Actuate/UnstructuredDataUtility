<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by Toronto Police Services Board for judicial review of decision by Information and Privacy Commissioner ordering it to issue access decisions in respect of requests for electronic data made by a journalist -- Journalist sought release of information with names of individuals replaced by unique randomly generated numbers -- He did not seek personal information or information that could potentially be used to identify individuals -- Board refused access on the ground that to fulfill the request would necessitate creation of documents by Board, which would be an enormous hardship and expense -- It argued Commissioner erred in failing to consider whether records could be produced by means that were "normally used by the institution" as required by Municipal Freedom of Information and Privacy Act -- HELD: Application allowed -- Commissioner concluded that a unique identifier existed in a form accessible through applicant's computer system, and that extraction of requested information was possible, although it would be time-consuming and would result in certain inaccuracies in information -- He did not consider words "normally used by the institution" found in s. 2(b) of Act -- Commissioner concluded that extracting and manipulating data to create record sought would not unreasonably interfere with operations of applicant, and would not constitute creating a new record -- Commissioner's failure to consider whether the means required to produce the record were means "normally used by the institution" was fatal to his decision -- Having failed to turn his mind to that question, decision could not stand, and it was quashed. </summary>
