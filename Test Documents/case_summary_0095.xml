<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>The plaintiff mother sought sole custody and access of the parties' children, a determination and division of family assets, child support and spousal support. The defendant father sought a reapportionment of family assets and an order that the plaintiff be held in contempt. The parties had four children. The plaintiff made allegations that the defendant was abusive towards her and the children during the marriage, but no complaints were made to persons in authority before the separation and it was not until the litigation was well underway that the plaintiff started alleging specific incidents. The defendant had a good relationship with the children R, T and V but was estranged from their older sister K. K was working for a janitorial company and had taken one university level course by distance learning in the previous four years. Neither party considered joint custody or guardianship workable. The defendant had shares in his father's company with a fixed value of $457,741 and had loaned the company some money, but owed $334,329 owing on a business loan taken out to purchase those shares. The defendant was the beneficiary of a family trust; the trustees had absolute discretion to pay income and/or capital for the benefit of any member of the class and neither party had any knowledge of the existence of the trust prior to their separation. The defendant claimed he owed debts to his parents totalling $380,653 but there were no documents executed at the time of the advances of the various sums of money but one cheque stub with respect to $50,000 made reference to a loan for the purchase of the truck. The defendant' income for child support purposes was $75,000. The plaintiff had not completed her grade 12 education when the parties first began living together but she had not taken any significant steps to become self-sufficient in the previous four years. The plaintiff attempted to justify her breaches of court orders with respect to access by saying that the children were sick, alleging third parties had told her not to facilitate access and by alleging the children did not wish to attend. 	HELD: The plaintiff was given interim custody and guardianship of R, T and V. It was in the best interests of R, T and V to have healthy relationships with both parents. The defendant was to have R, T and V every second weekend during the school year, for seven weeks during the summer vacation and for half of the Christmas vacation and for the first week of Spring Break. None of the plaintiff's allegations of abuse of the children had been proved. The defendant's contingent interest in the family trust was not a family asset as it was not used for a family purpose or relied on by the parties for future family security. The defendant's shares in his father's company and the loan he made to the company were family assets but they were gifts to be reapportioned 80 per cent to the defendant. The funds advanced by the defendant's father was not loans, but gifts, with the exception of the $50,000 truck loan. K was not currently a child of the marriage. The defendant was ordered to pay child support for R, T in V in the sum of $1,459 per month. The defendant was ordered to pay spousal support in the amount of $2,000 per month until August 1, 2009, to allow the plaintiff to make a transition to a reduced level of support, decreasing to $400 per month effective September 1, 2009. Income of $15,000 was imputed to the deliberately unemployed plaintiff for the purpose of calculating spousal support. The plaintiff was found in contempt of court orders and punishment would be imposed if the matter came back before the court on contempt proceedings. </summary>
