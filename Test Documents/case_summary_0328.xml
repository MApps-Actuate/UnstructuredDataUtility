<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Motion by the defendants to strike out two proposed common issues in a class proceeding. The defendants argued that these two issues were disclosed to them for the first time in the plaintiffs' factum for the certification motion which was to be heard in six days. The two issues concerned an alleged breach of duty of fair dealing by the defendants under the Arthur Wishart Act (Franchise Disclosure) and whether the court should award an aggregate assessment of monetary relief on behalf of some or all class members. The defendants alleged they were seriously prejudiced by the inclusion of these new issues in that they did not know the particulars of these issues and had not had the opportunity to introduce responding materials or to cross-examine the plaintiffs on these proposed common issues. 	HELD: Motion allowed in part. No extreme prejudice or any prejudice had been demonstrated by the defendants with respect to the allegedly late introduction of the issue about whether the court should award an aggregate assessment of damages on behalf of the class. This issue was not a matter that would take the able lawyers for the defendants by surprise. The plaintiffs' amended statement of claim, of which the defendants had notice, alleged they breached the Arthur Wishart Act (Franchise Disclosure) and Franchise Act. The factual basis for the common issue with respect to their alleged breaches of legislation was the same as the factual basis of the common issues for which the defendants had already cross-examined and filed material, and the plaintiffs were not relying on anything extra or different for this allegedly new common issue. The defendants had, however, been denied the opportunity to challenge the commonality of this issue both by cross-examination and by introduction of additional evidence. The plaintiffs were thus precluded from advancing this issue as a common issue at the certification motion. </summary>
