<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Trial of the accused charged with aggravated assault and breaking and entering a dwelling house with intent to commit an indictable offence. The accused was the complainants' business partner. The complainants alleged the accused broke into their home with an iron bar and assaulted them. The accused claimed that he was invited into the complainants' home and wanted to discuss their business issues. He alleged the complaints started to attack him with an iron bar and other kitchen objects. The complainants owed the accused a large amount of money. 	HELD: The accused was acquitted. The complaints' testimony was inconsistent and not believable. It was thus dangerous to base a conviction solely on their version of the events. Considering the evidence as a whole, the Crown had not proven the accused's guilt. The evidence in support of the charges had been met by explanations by the accused which might reasonably be true and if true, would warrant a dismissal of the charges unless the force used by him was more than was necessary to enable him to defend himself. Although this alternative was not advanced by the Crown, the court would have been unable to conclude that the accused used excessive force under all the circumstances. </summary>
