<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>The applicant mortgagors sought an order staying the issuance of a writ of possession by the mortgagee of certain property. The applicant Mrs. S bought the property in September 1989 for $700,000. She assumed a first mortgage in favour of GHC Ltd. on which $380,000 was owing and paid the balance of $320,000 in cash to the vendor. Mrs. S kept this first mortgage in good standing until the date of maturity. When the balance then remaining due and owing was not paid, GHC Ltd. commenced foreclosure proceedings and obtained a default judgment for sale in June 1992. 	HELD: The motion was dismissed. At issue was whether the applicants could avail themselves of the provisions of section 23 of the Mortgages Act. In the present case the default did not occur during the term of the mortgage. It occurred when the mortgage matured. The mortgage could not be placed back in good standing, because it had matured. The court did not believe that section 23 was intended to deal with this situation. </summary>
