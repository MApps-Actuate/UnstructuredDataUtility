<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by the wife against the respondent husband for the sale of the matrimonial home, sale of personal property by auction, unequal division of assets, designation of the wife as the beneficiary of the husband's $4,000 death benefit from his employer and spousal support -- Husband sought exclusive possession of the home, an unequal division of the net family property and control of his death benefit -- Husband was 69 years old and the wife was 62 -- Parties married in 1962 and separated on September 1, 2004 when the wife left the home -- Husband was the primary wage-earner during the marriage -- He worked until he was sidelined by an injury and then received workers' compensation until he retired -- Wife stayed at home and cared for the parties' six children -- She rented an apartment with a friend while the husband remained in the matrimonial home which was mortgage free -- Home was jointly owned -- Its fair market value was $77,000 -- Wife received $33,000 from her father's estate after the separation -- At the time of trial she had investments that totaled $67,904 -- Wife's monthly expenses were $1,454 -- Husband had an annual income of $29,431 or $2,185 per month -- His reasonable monthly expenses were $2,515 -- HELD: Application allowed in part -- There were no compelling reasons to grant the husband exclusive possession -- His preference to remain in the home did not justify the order for exclusive possession -- Husband was therefore not entitled to exclusive possession -- Court refused to divide the net family property unequally in favour of either party -- Neither party made reference to this claim in their evidence or submissions -- If the husband bought the wife's interest in the home he had to pay her an equalization payment of $30,673 plus her interest in the home -- Upon her receipt of the funds she would transfer her interest to him -- If the husband decided not to buy the wife's interest he was to pay her $30,673 plus half of the net sale proceeds of the home -- In either case the wife was entitled to a charging order against the husband's interest in the home and RRIF as security for sums owing for the property under this judgment -- Parties agreed to sell certain vehicles -- These proceeds would be divided equally between the parties and were in addition to the equalization payment -- Auction of chattels in the husband's possession was denied because there were sufficient assets to satisfy the equalization payment so the sale was not necessary -- Regarding spousal support the wife had her investments and would receive an equalization payment -- If she invested this total, which amounted to $98,577, she would have annual interest income of $4,435 or $369 per month -- Each spouse would also have an equivalent interest in the home -- When the husband's pension was divided the wife's monthly income would increase to $1,126 or $13,512 -- If the husband died the wife would receive 75 per cent of the pension -- Administrator of the husband's pension was ordered to pay half of the monthly pension to the wife -- Wife was unable to work because of her age and because she suffered from degenerative disc disease -- Until the wife received her share of the pension the husband was to pay her monthly spousal support of $816 -- Once the pension was received the payments would be reduced to $400 per month -- To secure the payment of spousal support the husband was to name the wife as a beneficiary of the death benefit for as long he had to pay spousal support. </summary>
