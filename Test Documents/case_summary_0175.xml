<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by Garnett for judicial review of a decision of the Assessment and Planning Appeal Board ("the PAB") in which it upheld a decision of the City of Saint John Planning Advisory Committee ("the PAC") to grant variances to Farnsworth and Jones to permit them to build an addition to their home so that Farnsworth and his wife and two children could move in with Jones -- The property was zoned RS-1 one and two family suburban residential and was serviced by an on-site septic system -- It and the neighbouring properties were also serviced by on-site wells -- Garnett owned the neighbouring property -- He alleged that he would suffer a special or unreasonable hardship as a result of the PAC's decision, particularly that because there would be more people living at the Jones house than before, there would be more stress on the septic system -- Garnett contended that the PAB and the PAC misapprehended the authority of the Department of Health to deal with on-site sewage disposal systems under the General Regulation of the Health Act -- This misapprehension occurred, he submitted, as a result of the statement in the planning department's report to the PAC that the application for the variances had been sent to the Department of Health without stating more, which Garnett contended left the PAC and the PAB with the impression that the Department of Health supported the variances -- HELD: Application dismissed -- The PAB did not make a finding that the Department of Health supported the application though there was evidence to support such a finding -- More importantly, there was no evidence before this Court, either direct or inferred, to support Garnett's submission that when it decided the issues the PAB interpreted or misinterpreted the General Regulation of the Health Act. </summary>
