<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by union for injunction against hotel, restraining it from interfering with picket line -- Strike commenced July 1, 2005 -- On July 1, 2007, three security guards employed by hotel allegedly assaulted Gingras, national union representative coordinating strike near hotel -- Claimed he was bumped, verbally abused, knocked off sidewalk to street where he was almost struck by vehicle, and suffered knee injury which caused him to miss work -- Claimed activities of security guards were intimidating and threatening -- Gingras claimed four women on picket line at time of assault were shaken and frightened, and could not return to picket line for fear for their safety -- One guard claimed Gingras initiated physical confrontation, and denied Gingras was almost hit by car -- Video of incident showed Gingras was pushed, causing him to go onto side of street -- Video did not clearly show how close car was to hitting Gingras -- HELD: Application dismissed -- Although video did not completely confirm union's version of events, actions of hotel's employees were improper -- No evidence showed picketers never able to return to picket line after incident -- Sufficient evidence supported union's claim hotel employees were intimidating union members and threatening battery and assault, so union established serious issue to be tried -- Short interruption in picketing by certain members caused by incident insufficient to establish irreparable harm -- Balance of convenience favoured hotel, where injunction union sought would severely limit hotel's ability to operate -- Order was in place already, restraining hotel from intimidating, coercing or interfering with picket line. </summary>
