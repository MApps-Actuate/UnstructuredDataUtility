<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Ruling respecting costs of an interlocutory injunction motion brought by the plaintiff to restrain the defendant Rust-Oleum from further distribution or sale of the Stone Effects Countertop Coating product pending trial. The plaintiff also sued its former employee Lobreau for breach of employment contract and release of confidential information. The injunction was refused. The defendants were represented by separate counsel on the motion. Rust-Oleum sought costs of $103,525 and Lobreau sought costs of $97,974. 	HELD: Rust-Oleum was awarded costs of $43,620. Lobreau was awarded costs of $24,059. Since the allegations with respect to breach of the employment agreement and the release of confidential information and trade secrets were more applicable to Lobreau rather than Rust-Oleum, it was appropriate for the defendants to retain separate counsel. Considering that the action should have been commenced in Toronto, rather than Ottawa, the disbursements relating to travel and accommodation were reasonable. The fees claimed by the defendants were excessive. In a motion of this type, the fees should be set at $60,000 plus disbursements, plus GST. </summary>
