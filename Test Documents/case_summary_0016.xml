<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Trial of Reeves on charges of assault, assault with a weapon and uttering a death threat. The alleged victim was Reeves common-law wife, Barnett. Barnett called 911 and gave a statement to the responding officer that Reeves assaulted and threatened her after becoming angry that a man had telephoned Barnett. Her descriptions of he punches and kicks administered to her by Reeves was not entirely consistent with the injuries the officer witnessed. The officer noted Barnett's home was in disarray, leading her to believe a physical altercation had taken place. The officer did not note signs of extreme impairment or intoxication when she took Barnett's statement. At Reeves' trial, Barnett testified her statement to the officer was completely false, and that she made it because she was angry at Reeves for refusing to go buy cocaine with her. She explained her injuries as being the result of an altercation she had with a friend, Rose, with whom she had been doing cocaine and drinking beer with all day. She claimed she was highly intoxicated when she gave her statement to the police, noting she twice referred to a brother who did not exist. Shorty, Reeves' cousin, also testified at the trial. He claimed Reeves was with him at his residence at the time the alleged assault occurred. Shorty's residence was an hour's drive from Barnett's residence. Shorty testified Reeves called him two or three days later, informing him of the charges against him. The defence was only made aware of Shorty's evidence a few weeks before Reeves' trial. There was evidence Barnett and Reeves had been sharing expenses prior to him being charged, after which Barnett became responsible for all her expenses. 	HELD: Reeves was acquitted of all charges. Barnett's out-of-court statement was admitted for the truth of its contents. Barnett was able to communicate what happened that night, regardless of the fact she appeared slightly intoxicated. The officer took Barnett's statement contemporaneously with her response to the 911 call and was able to confirm a physical altercation occurred from the state of Barnett's residence. The credibility of Shorty's evidence was called into question by the fact he did not tell the defence about it until a few weeks before Reeves' trial. The court was not convinced Shorty was correct about the date Reeves visited him. Barnett's testimony that Rose assaulted her also lacked credibility. It was notable that she failed to refer to Rose in the statement to the police. The evidence did not support her claimed of extreme intoxication at the time she gave her statement. The fact Barnett had to pay all her own expenses after Reeves was charged showed she had motivation to get him back in her life by lying about whether or not he assaulted her. The inconsistencies with Barnett's account of the altercation with Reeves in her statement to the police gave rise to a reasonable doubt Reeves was guilty of the offences charged. </summary>
