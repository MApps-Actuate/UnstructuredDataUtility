<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Appeal by the accused, Dao, from conviction for possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking, cultivation of marijuana and theft of electricity over $5,000. The accused and another individual were arrested in connection with a marijuana grow operation. The other individual was the registered owner of the home and was registered on the hydro bill. A hydro bypass device resulted in the theft of $17,550 worth of electricity. The device was visible in the basement where the growing operation was located. The home itself was sparsely furnished. A television was set on a timer. There was no food or clothing in the house. The other individual was acquitted at trial. Police surveillance placed the accused's vehicle inside the garage at the residence for substantial periods of time on three occasions. On the last occasion, the accused was positively identified following a traffic stop. The trial judge noted that the garage door was opened by an electronic device, and that the marijuana had been manually tended to. The judge noted that a door from the garage was barricaded on the house side. The judge reasoned that the accused had access to the house, as it was unlikely that he would sit in an empty garage for significant lengths of time. The judge concluded that it was pure speculation to consider any explanation inconsistent with the guilt of the accused. A conviction was entered on all counts. The accused appealed on the basis that the judge erred in concluding that he had knowledge and control of the marijuana, and that the reasons for judgment were inadequate. 	HELD: Appeal allowed in part. The totality of the evidence supported the only reasonable conclusion that the accused was guilty of possession for the purposes of trafficking. The judge noted that the owner of the home lived in another residence with the accused, there was a strong odour of marijuana in the home, the accused was present at the home on three occasions, the marijuana required manual care, the accused had a garage door opener, the marijuana had significant value, and there was no other explanation for the accused's presence. The only rational explanation for the accused's presence was to attend to the growing operation. The accused had knowledge and control of the operation while present at the residence. However, there were no findings of fact, evidence of intent, or reasons provided for the conviction for theft of electricity. Even if the accused knew of the hydro bypass, there was no evidence that his presence at the home was for anything other than cultivation of the plants. The conviction for participation in the growing operation did not support a conviction for theft of electricity. The conviction for theft was set aside. </summary>
