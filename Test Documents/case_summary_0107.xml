<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Appeal by the accused from a sentence of nine years imprisonment for manslaughter after three years credit for pre-trial custody served. The appellant and an accomplice entered the victim's residence to steal drugs or money. The appellant was masked and armed with a loaded handgun and a small knife. The appellant confronted the victim, stabbed him and then shot him. The appellant was 17 at the time of the offence and had pleaded guilty. The appellant was sentenced as an adult. He had a prior youth record including two robbery convictions. Based on the pre-sentence report, the trial judge concluded that there was a high risk that the appellant would use violence in the future. The appellant argued the sentencing judge failed to consider his youth, his guilty plea and his remorse. 	HELD: Appeal dismissed. The sentencing judge did not fail to consider the factors bearing on the appellant's youth status or fail to give those factors sufficient weight. The judge recognized that the guilty plea was a demonstration that the appellant acknowledged responsibility for his actions and was prepared to accept the consequences. Based on the psychological assessment and the fact that the appellant continued to offend after the present offences, it was open for the sentencing judge to conclude that the appellant's guilty plea was insincere. Protection of the public, maintenance of confidence in the administration of justice and a lengthy sentence to hold the appellant accountable were primary considerations. The sentence imposed was not demonstrably unfit. </summary>
