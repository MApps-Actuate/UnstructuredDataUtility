<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Appeal by Hung and Khang Nguyen from their convictions for possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking. The pair was witnessed by two independent observers arriving at a garage and placing a bag inside, then waiting there. One observer called the police, who arrived to find the two accused present in the garage. Three bags containing marijuana valued at between $310,000 and $620,000 were also located in the garage. The trial judge found the Crown proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the two accused were the persons witnessed entering the garage with one of the bags, despite the frailties of eyewitness evidence. He was also convinced the accused had possession and knowledge of the contents of the bags. He accepted testimony from Hung that he and his brother Khang arrived at the garage 30 minutes before the police, which corresponded to the time the eyewitness claimed to have seen the accused. He rejected Hung's claim the pair were at the garage to help a friend, not called to testify, to help move some furniture. He found it logical that the accused would stay around to guard the marijuana after delivering it to the garage. He found it too remote a possibility that some other persons had entered the garage and delivered the marijuana bags after the accused arrived but before the police arrived. He considered the presence of $42,000 in cash in Khang's vehicle support for the conclusion they were engaged in the drug trade. 	HELD: Appeals dismissed. The judge did not misapprehend the evidence, nor did he reverse the burden of proof to the accused in rejecting their story about being at the garage to move furniture. It was legitimate for the judge to infer knowledge of the contents of the bags from the physical possession of one of the bags by the accused. The judge gave adequate reasons for rejecting Hung's testimony. </summary>
