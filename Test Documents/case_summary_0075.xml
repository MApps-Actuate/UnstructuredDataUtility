<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by former Anthem shareholders for an order requiring Anthem to pay interest on the value of their shares. Anthem wanted to go private and offered shareholders $15 for their shares. The plaintiffs did not want the privatization to go through, but on May 14, 2005, tendered their shares along with notices of dissent when the privatization was approved by 97 percent of Anthem'[s shareholders. The plaintiffs demanded the fair market value of their shares and filed a petition for this relief. Anthem offered them $16 for their shares on April 8, 2005, together with interest payable from May 19, 2004 to the date of payment. The plaintiffs continued with the litigation, but accepted Anthem's offer on June 12, 2006. Anthem paid the plaintiffs the principal amount of $4,276,800 for their shares on July 4, 2006. 	HELD: Application allowed. The plaintiffs were entitled to some interest because they received more than they were initially offered for their shares and because they were denied the benefits of either share ownership or payment from the date they tendered their shares to the date they were paid. There was no reason to depart from the normal procedure of allowing post-judgment interest at the Bank of Canada prime rate from May 14, 2005 to July 4, 2006, and pre-judgment interest at the prime rate less two percent. Interest was to be calculated on the entire amount paid for the plaintiffs' shares, not the premium paid for the shares. There was no basis for awarding interest based on what Anthem might have incurred in borrowing costs had it paid the plaintiffs for their shares on May 14, 2005. </summary>
