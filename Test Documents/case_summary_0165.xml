<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Trial of the accused, Conroy, for possession of alcohol in a manner that contravened the Liquor Control Act -- The accused arranged to meet friends at a marina to partake in a boat trip on a river -- The boat was a 44-foot converted lobster vessel equipped with beds and a toilet -- The accused placed eight cans of beer in a cooler bag, partially zipped it closed, and placed it on the front seat of his truck -- The truck did not have a locked compartment in which the beer could otherwise be stored -- Police on routine patrol approached the accused and his wife as they waited for their friends in an adjacent restaurant parking lot -- The officer observed the unopened beer cans inside the partially unzipped cooler bag, issued a ticket and seized them -- There was no evidence that the beer was consumed prior to, or at the time of the seizure -- There was no evidence of empty beer cans in or around the truck -- At issue was whether the accused's possession of the beer cans was lawful under the Act -- Also at issue was whether the boat qualified as a residence under the Act -- HELD: Conroy was acquitted -- The possession of the alcohol was lawful -- The accused was in compliance with s. 41(3) of the Act, as the cans of beer were not opened while in transit -- The fact that the cans were originally part of a 12-pack did not detract from their legal status as unopened packages, as each can constituted an individual package for the purpose of the Act -- The boat had the necessary accoutrements of a living place such that it qualified as a residence under the Act -- It was immaterial that the accused stopped for dinner during the conveyance of the alcohol from his residence to the boat, as the Act did not require the alcohol to be conveyed directly or immediately -- There was no evidence as to whether the alcohol would be unlawfully consumed on the boat -- Mere possession of the beer on board was not unlawful. </summary>
