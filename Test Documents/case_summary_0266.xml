<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by the defendant, Baxter, to strike all or parts of the plaintiff, Inkworks', claim. Inkworks claimed that Baxter, a senior officer and director of Inkworks, breached his fiduciary duty to the company by appropriating a valuable intellectual property asset owned by the company. Baxter claimed that the as the company had failed to lead evidence either establishing ownership of the intellectual property or the existence of a duty, there was no cause of action. 	HELD: Application dismissed. If Inkworks could establish that one of its three founding shareholders ran off with a product that all had planned to share in equally with the result that the company was deprived of an asset, a remedy might be ordered. Accordingly, it was not appropriate to dismiss the claim. It was noted that in his counterclaim for wrongful dismissal, Baxter alleged an employment relationship, the very missing averment that he complained rendered Inkworks' claim inadequate. </summary>
