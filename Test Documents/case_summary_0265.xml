<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by the accused for an order excluding from evidence all observations made and items seized as well as any forensic examination of those items. The accused was charged with producing and possessing with intent to traffic the drug ecstasy. Based on information obtained through a general warrant and three subsequent warrants, the accused was arrested and a variety of items were seized. The accused submitted that the critical events regarding whether he was planning to or producing ecstacy were not established in the application for the warrants and that the only information which the police had was some historical information regarding purchases of chemicals and some connection with the location that was searched. He argued that the information was unreliable in that it contained mistakes of substance. He specifically challenged the information that he personally attended at the Toronto chemical supplier and paid cash for a large quantity of sassafras oil or that he had personally unloaded the sassafras oil from the transporting van. The accused claimed that he was out of the country at the time the oil was picked up in Toronto. He argued that there were many discrepancies in the various police reports reviewed by the detective who had prepared the application/information and which called into question the accuracy of the information. Iinformation that was included in the application included chemical purchases dating back to 2000 by a person fitting the accused's description, the identification of the person as the accused by employees of the chemical supplier, his connection to the van used to transport the sassafras oil and his criminal record and association with the criminal underworld. In addition, the officer stated that had he known the accused was absent from Canada, he would have included this information in the application. 	HELD: Application dismissed. There was more than sufficient evidence or information on oath placed before the issuing judge of reasonable grounds to believe that an offence or offences had been or would be committed. The admission of the evidence sought to be excluded would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute nor would it deprive the accused of his right to a fair trial. Any factual errors contained in the application/information were not fraudulent or deliberate, but were due to inadvertence. Some confusion and some discrepancies were not unusual where several investigating officers were involved. On a balance of probabilities, the discrepancies in their degree, number and seriousness did not convince the court that the warrants should not have been issued. An overall review of the information placed before the judge provided sufficient grounds for a conclusion by the judge that the accused was the person unloading the oil in Ottawa. </summary>
