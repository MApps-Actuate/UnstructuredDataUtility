<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by the plaintiffs for directions with respect to the process to be followed in this case in seeking court approval of a settlement involving infants. The plaintiffs sought an order that the application be held in camera to ensure the amount of the settlement be kept confidential. The defendant sought leave to make submissions on the application for court approval. 	HELD: The settlement application was not to be held in camera. There was no evidence that the infant plaintiffs would suffer harm if the settlement were disclosed. One of the purposes of requiring the court to approve settlements of this kind was to ensure that the public could be satisfied that the best interests of the infant plaintiffs had been protected. That required openness and public access to the terms of the settlement, the submissions in favour of it and the court's reasons for approving or disapproving it. Whether or not the defendant should be permitted to make submissions on the application could only be determined after the plaintiff filed its materials in support of the application. </summary>
