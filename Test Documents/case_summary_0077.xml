<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by the mother of two for joint custody of the children, a shared parenting regime with shared decision-making, child and spousal support and an unequal division of the family debts. The father sought sole custody. The shared parenting regime sought by the mother was recommended by an assessment report. The parties separated after a six-year relationship. The mother and children remained in the family home. The mother and father had an extremely tumultuous relationship and they highly distrusted each other. Both made allegations the other was an unfit parent and both failed to cooperate with each other in parenting the children. Some of the allegations against both were borne out by the evidence, but the assessor found both fit parents and recommended the continuation of a shared parenting arrangement by way of which the children spent alternate weeks with each parent. The father earned more money than the mother. His estimated income for 2009 was $63,636. The mother estimated her income would be $24,000 but the father claimed she could earn more, citing the fact she earned $25,000 over a seven-month period in 2008. After the parties separated, the father continued to pay the mortgage on the family home but paid no child support. He also paid interest on the family debt. His contributions totalled more than $17,000 up to the date of the trial. During the marriage, the mother was the primary caregiver for the children for a short time. She had quit the job she had when the parties got together to fulfil this role, but later built up a cleaning business. The father worked hard in his career as a deckhand and spent some money on retraining after the parties separated to enhance his earning potential. It was likely the parties would be left with a significant debt after the family assets were disposed of, because the bank had foreclosed on the mortgage on the family home. The father knew about the foreclosure proceedings and assumed the mother was informed by the bank. He took no steps to communicate with the mother about the impending foreclosure. The mother claimed she had no ability to contribute to this debt. 	HELD: Joint custody was ordered for the children. Although the mother was less stable than the father and he was more rigid and less willing to compromise than the mother, neither party proved the other was an unfit parent. The parties were also to share guardianship and decision making with respect to the children. Giving the father decision-making authority would essentially deny the mother a role in the process because the father was unable to communicate with or consider the mother's point of view. The father was ordered to pay an amount of child support to set off the differences in the parties' respective incomes. The father's past contributions exceeded what he would have had to pay in support so no retroactive support was ordered. The mother's 2009 income was more reasonably estimated at $28,800 and the father was therefore required to pay $508 per month in ongoing support. The father was responsible for paying daycare costs, as long as the mother sought a daycare subsidy as the lower income earner. The mother was entitled to some spousal support on a non-compensatory basis. She was awarded $325 per month, payable until a review in July 2011. Retroaction spousal support was also ordered because the mother had a need of support after the parties separated that the father ignored. The father was ordered to pay any debt arising from the foreclosure action. The mother had no ability to contribute to any debt and the father could have handled the matter better. </summary>
