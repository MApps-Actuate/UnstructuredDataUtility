<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Action for medical malpractice and sexual assault -- Defendant general surgeon performed liposuction on plaintiff -- Plaintiff's skin had irregularities, lumpiness and scarring after procedure -- Plaintiff alleged he examined her breasts without clinical reason and disfigured her by negligently performing liposuction procedure and removing too much fat -- Plaintiff was exotic dancer and lived high risk lifestyle -- Prior to surgery, plaintiff was provided with literature and video regarding liposuction -- Plaintiff did not ask any questions and confirmed she was not concerned about liposuction because she had seen others at work who had undergone liposuction -- Defendant explained procedure to plaintiff and attendant risks shortly prior to surgery -- HELD: Action dismissed -- While results of defendant's liposuction surgery were clearly unacceptable to plaintiff, a cause of serious distress to her, and did not provide a perfect result, they were not, by themselves, sufficient evidence to establish a breach of standard of care -- Skin irregularities were within normal realm for such surgery -- Defendant's performance of procedure did not fall below standard of practice and outcome was not sub-optimal -- No failure to obtain informed consent -- Risks were properly and adequately spelled out to plaintiff -- Plaintiff had made up her mind to have liposuction procedure and was intent upon proceeding -- Even though she was informed that liposuction would re-contour and remove inches rather than pounds, she knowingly took the risk and opted for surgery which she now regretted -- No credible evidence to base a finding that defendant manually examined her breasts without her consent or without clinical justification. </summary>
