The defendants caused to be built a storage building and lived in a trailer on the property. The Municipal Board amended the bylaw to allow a dwelling but the location was firmly controlled. The defendant's trailer was not within the allowed location. The defendant also carried on an appliance repair business in contravention of the bylaw. The applicant had dealt in a consistent manner with the defendant who knew that his uses were not permitted. 	HELD: A permanent injunction was granted restraining the defendants from residential occupation of the storage shed and from carrying on the appliance repair business. A stay of operation was granted regarding the use of the trailer. The storage shed had to be brought within the applicable municipal regulatory system or it would have to be demolished. </summary>
