<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Determination of costs. The defendant Hill offered to settle for $60,738 less the advance payment of $12,000. The jury's award to the plaintiffs, less the advance, resulted in a total payment of $58,635 to the plaintiffs. The defendants Hnatiuk served no offer. The plaintiffs served a written offer to settle on all defendants whereby the plaintiffs were to receive $800,000 after deductions of advance payments. The plaintiffs recovered $1,035,183 against Hnatiuk and $58,635 against Hill. Hill asked that solicitor and client costs not be awarded and that costs be payable on a party and party basis. Hill was responsible for only five per cent of the total award. Hnatiuk argued that the proper scale of costs was on a party and party basis and that the plaintiffs failed to comply strictly with the requirements of Rule 49.10(1). The jury blamed the bulk of the plaintiffs' injuries on the first accident. The defendant State Farm made an offer with respect to one action, it consented to the dismissal of the action with costs to be agreed upon or assessed. The offer was not accepted. The jury found that there was no negligence on the part of the uninsured motorist and the action against State Farm was dismissed. Hnatiuk put up no defence. 	HELD: The plaintiffs were entitled to party and party costs up to the date of their offer and solicitor and client costs thereafter to be fixed by the court. The plaintiffs were ordered to pay the costs of State Farm on a party and party basis to be fixed. Hill was responsible for five per cent of the costs. The court should depart from the prima facie costs consequences set out in Rule 49.10(1) only where the interest of justice required it. Offers to settle should not be considered on an issue by issue basis. Where the plaintiff obtained a judgment generally more favourable than the offer, the cost consequences of Rule 49.10 should be invoked. The plaintiff obtained a judgment more favourable than any offer to settle. There was no interest of justice which would require the Court to depart from the prima facie cost consequences of the Rule. There was no contractual liability on the part of State Farm. The plaintiffs could have awaited the outcome of the trial and if the uninsured motorist was found 100 per cent liable, the plaintiffs could have looked to State Farm under the terms of the contract. Throughout the trial State Farm was unnecessarily attacked by the plaintiffs and Hnatiuk. The State Farm action was founded in contract and the other four actions in tort. Hnatiuk was not responsible for any costs of State Farm. The decision to include State Farm and not to accept its offer to settle was made by the plaintiffs who must abide by the consequence of that decision. </summary>
