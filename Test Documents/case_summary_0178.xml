<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Appeal by the Executive Director of Assessment of a decision of the Assessment and Planning Appeal Board that allowed an appeal by the Rothesay Regional Joint Board of Police Commissioners of the Director's assessment of its property for the taxation years 2002 and 2003 and reduced the assessments from $578,000 and $578,200 respectively to $480,900 for both taxation years -- The Police Commission retained de Stecher Appraisals in 2001 to prepare an appraisal of the property to give them an estimate of its current market value in anticipation of it sale -- The appraisal used two approaches to valuation -- The first, the cost approach, involved using the Marshall Valuation Service, which was described in the report as a reliable cost guide, and choosing from that a method which provided separate consideration for each major component in the building and adjusting for variations and architects' fees -- The appraiser then modified the total to reflect the effective date of the cost survey and the location of the building and concluded that the replacement cost would be $541,497 -- He then added the value of the land ($168,000) and physical improvements to the site ($23,000) and subtracted an allowance for depreciation ($202,874) and concluded that the value using the cost approach was $529,000 -- The second method, the direct comparison approach, involved a comparison of similar properties which had sold recently and adjusting for differences -- He found four comparable properties that had sold in the Saint John and, after he adjusted for differences, focused on two which had sold for an average of $54.52/sq. ft. -- He then multiplied that number by the square footage and concluded that the value, using that approach, was $393,000 -- He concluded that the direct comparison approach was the only reliable method in the circumstances and that the market value as of the date of his appraisal, July 9, 2001, was $393,000 -- In 2002 the Director assessed the property at $689,500 -- The Police Commission appealed the assessment using the de Stecher appraisal -- The Director's assessor considered the appraisal and the various approaches used to determine real and true value -- He decided that the property was a special purpose property, suitable for its present use but not very suitable for sale or lease and that the cost approach would therefore provide the best assessment of its real and true value -- He applied that approach and amended the assessment to $578,000 for the year 2002 -- The Police Commission appealed that decision to the Board -- When the 2003 assessment came out at $578,200 it was also appealed and the Director's assessor again used the cost approach, and confirmed the assessment -- That decision was also appealed to the Board -- The Assessment and Planning Appeal Board allowed the appeals and directed the Director to vacate the assessments for the 2002 and 2003 taxation years and to substitute an assessment of $480,900 for each of those years -- HELD: Appeal allowed in part -- The foundation of the Board's decision was that the two approaches to valuation should be blended -- This was a reasonable conclusion when the Board's expertise was taken into account -- The adjustment itself was neither excessive nor unreasonably modest -- The Court amended the Board's determination -- It substituted the Director's valuation of $583,400 using the cost approach for that of the appraiser -- When that was blended with the direct comparison valuation obtained by the Board ($432,720) the result was an assessed value of $508,100. </summary>
