<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by the plaintiff for declaratory and injunctive relief in connection with an option to purchase contained in a lease of industrial property. The matter proceeded as a limited application for an interim interlocutory injunction to preserve until a hearing on the merits of the plaintiff's claim that the option to purchase had not expired. The defendant offered to lease to Brink Forest Products Ltd. ("BFP"), for an initial three year term, 70 acres of a large unsubdivided property which had accommodated various sawmill operations since approximately 1965. The offer included a provision that if the tenant had not exercised the option to purchase by the end of the initial three year term, the landlord agreed to lease the premises to JAB Properties Inc. for a further three year period on the same terms, including the option to purchase. BFP and the defendant signed a formal lease agreement in May 2005 which described a parcel of 98.6 acres and expressly provided that the provision of the offer to lease survived and did not merge upon the execution of the lease. In August 2006, JAB Properties Inc. sold and assigned its interest in the lease to a numbered company which later changed its name to that of the present plaintiff. In October 2006, the parties amended the offer to lease to adjust the rental to account for the enlarged acreage. In 2005, John Brink, the president and sole shareholder of the plaintiff, JAB Properties Inc. and BFP applied for a building permit to construct a new building to house a sawmill on the premises. Approximately $4.5 million to $5 million had been spent on the construction of the specialty sawmill which had been put on hold as the plaintiff had not been able to obtain a purchase price from the defendant and was unable to secure continued funding for the project. A dispute arose when the defendant took steps to accelerate the expiry of the option period by notice as provided in the agreement which required to plaintiff to exercise the option within 40 days of the receipt of notice or it lost the right to do so. The plaintiff was advised by the defendant that it had registered a subdivision plan on title and had appointed an appraiser to determine the purchase price. The appraisal was provided the opinion that the market value of the property was $2,400,000 exclusive of G.S.T. and made several assumption or qualifications in respect of unknown or potential environmental issues. An environmental assessment procured by the plaintiff, which was not included on the appraiser's report, indicated that the cost of clean-up and remediation of the site was $3,700,000 to $8,250,000. The plaintiff was concerned with the independence of the appraiser and also took the position that the appraisal did not comply with the agreement in that it did not adequately take into account the environmental conditions of the premises. 	HELD: Application allowed. There was at least one fair question to be tried and the plaintiff had a strong prima facie case on the issue of whether the appraisal provided satisfied the criteria set out in the terms of the option to purchase agreement. The plaintiff was a holding company that held the option to purchase for the benefit of Brink Forest Products Ltd. and harm to Brink Forest Products Ltd. qualified as harm to the plaintiff. Brink Forest Products Ltd. stood to lose a business opportunity and suppliers, customers and business reputation. Such losses were real, not speculative and qualified as irreparable harm. The only harm that would accrue to the defendant from a preservation of the plaintiff's option to purchase pending a hearing of the issue on the merits was that the defendant would be delayed or hindered in marketing the premises in the intervening time period. As a condition of the granting of the interim interlocutory injunction, the undertaking as to damages was to be provided by the plaintiff and Brink Forest Products Ltd. jointly and severally. </summary>
