<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Motion by the husband for interim joint custody of the children and an order prohibiting the wife from consuming alcohol when the children were in her care. He also sought an order requiring the wife to pay all costs associated with the matrimonial home. The parties were married for 18 years. They had two children. The children were nine and 12 years old. The father had recently moved from the matrimonial home. An assessment report was prepared for the parties. 	HELD: Motion allowed in part. The parties were entitled to joint custody. The children were to be in the care of the wife for the majority of the time. The father was entitled to alternate weekend access, as well as additional access during the week. There was no evidence that the wife had any problem with alcohol. The liability for the home expenses would be determined at trial. The assessment report was not helpful, as there had been a change in circumstances since its preparation. Other issues were not addressed in the report. An equal sharing of time by the parents would not address the children's need for stability and routine. </summary>
