<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Motion by the plaintiff for an interim or interlocutory injunction. The plaintiff was in a dispute with the defendant landlord concerning their lease agreement. No written lease was ever executed and the plaintiff had spent over $200,000 in leasehold improvements for its coffee production and retail facility. When the plaintiff disagreed with the defendant concerning the amount of rent to be paid, the defendant sent an eviction notice. In order for an interim injunction to be granted, plaintiff had to meet a three-part test. The defendant agreed there was a serious issue to be tried and that the balance of convenience favoured the plaintiff if irreparable harm could be proven. The real issue concerned whether or not the plaintiff would suffer irreparable harm if the interim injunction was not granted and the eviction notice was allowed to stand. The plaintiff argued that it would be put out of business. 	HELD: Motion allowed. On the evidence, the plaintiff was able to prove that it would suffer irreparable harm by being put out of business if the interim injunction was not granted. It did not need to produce actuarial or other expert evidence to support an urgent matter of this nature. The relief was temporary and the evidence was sufficient to support the conclusion that irreparable harm would result if the injunction was not granted. Defendant's request for placing a time limit on the injunction and that $1,000 per month of the rent be paid into court pending the trial of this action was rejected. </summary>
