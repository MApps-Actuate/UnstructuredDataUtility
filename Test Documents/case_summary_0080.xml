<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Appeal by Hutchison from the registrar's decision to allow his fees at one-half the amount billed. The client was a golf club and Hutchison was the club's honourary solicitor. A contractor who had performed drainage and irrigation work for the club commenced an action against the club to recover $250,000. Hutchison offered the club his services on a fee for service basis and the club accepted. Ultimately, Hutchison billed the club fees of $100,067. The club was aggrieved over the amount and sought review of all of the accounts. The registrar subsequently determined that $50,000 was a fair overall fee. Hutchison took the position that the registrar erred in finding that the periodic accounts were not final bills and by reviewing the accounts despite finding that there was a fee agreement between the solicitor and the club. Hutchison further submitted that the registrar failed to consider the fee agreement and did not provide specific reasons for his decision. 	HELD: Appeal dismissed. The registrar made no palpable or overriding error in determining that the periodic accounts were not final bills. Therefore, it was open to the registrar to review all of the accounts. Also, the Legal Profession Act expressly provided that the registrar was not limited by the terms of the fee agreement. Furthermore, the registrar did consider the agreement but found that the fee rate was inappropriately high when all relevant factors were considered. Finally, while the registrar's reasons may not have contained mathematical precision, they provided a sound basis for his decision. </summary>
