<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Action by the defendant's common law wife for child and spousal support, and division of the defendant's property. The parties had a relationship of from 1988 to 2005. The wife had a child, now 24, from a prior marriage. The child was supported by the defendant throughout her minority. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant was unjustly enriched by her efforts by which she suffered deprivation. The defendant, 55, was a medial doctor. The plaintiff upgraded her education by taking university courses during the relationship and became a medical officer assistant I the defendant's medical practice. The parties had purchased a farm registered in both names and pure bred hoses to commence a horse breeding business. The business failed. The plaintiff still resided on the farm with her daughter and operated a money-losing business. The daughter operated a kennel business from the farm and had training in both law and medical offices. 	HELD: Action dismissed. The plaintiff had a claim to her interest in the farm only. The plaintiff failed to establish any enrichment enjoyed by the defendant through her contributions, nor had she established that she has suffered a corresponding deprivation. The plaintiff upgraded her education during the relationship and earned a salary and held RRSPs and an interest in the farm. The plaintiff had made no contribution to the defendant's medical practice. The plaintiff had the ability to earn $50,000 but chose not to. She was thus not entitled to spousal support. Based on the daughter's educational background and the fact that she was earning money from her kennel business, it was not established that she was unable to withdraw from parental charge. She had also unilaterally terminated her relationship with the defendant as she refused any contact with him without any reasonable ground. </summary>
