<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Appeal by the wife, and cross-appeal by the husband, from an order dealing with child and spousal support. The husband was a medical professional and the wife was a non-practicing lawyer. There was no evidence establishing that she was unable to work due to the traumatic circumstances of the parties' breakup. The child was five years old at the time of trial. The order awarded the wife $10,500 in spousal support and $3,500 in child support. The judge found that the husband took in $630,000 from all his income sources in 2006, but attributed only $425,000 to him as income for the purpose of determining the support he should pay. The judge noted that the husband did not take all the earnings available to him from his medical corporation during the parties' marriage, and consequently did not find it necessary to add all of the corporation's retained earnings to the husband's personal income. The judge made the spousal support order retroactive to May 2006, the date that the husband first started paying spousal support of $7,500 voluntarily, and ordered a review in four years. The order was made in August 2007 so the review date was set for August 2011. 	HELD: Appeal by the wife allowed; cross-appeal by the husband allowed in part. Given that the husband's corporation was a medical services professional corporation, it was not necessary for the corporation to retain income for company purposes. Other than the husband's desire to build up savings in the corporation, there were no legitimate calls on his pre-tax corporate income. His child was entitled to support based on the full income available to the husband. The retroactive support ordered by the judge was basically fair to both parties, but the review date was moved back from August 2011 to May 2010 to reflect the proper review period of four years from the effective date of the support order. This would give the wife adequate time to decide if she wanted to pursue an alternative career and the child would be in school by then. </summary>
