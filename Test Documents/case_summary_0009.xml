<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Action by an employee for damages for wrongful dismissal. In 1983, the plaintiff began to sell vinyl siding for the predecessor of the defendant on a part-time basis. In 1992, he joined the defendant on a full-time basis as an Energy Advisor and his job was to secure residential and commercial contracts for the sale and installation of windows. The parties had a written contract which outlined the plaintiff's territory, earnings and benefits. Throughout his employment with the defendant, the plaintiff was enrolled in a group benefit program which was available only to full-time employees. In 1996, the defendant developed and implemented an employee share ownership plan which allowed employees and dedicated contractors to purchase share in the company. The defendant also paid out bonuses to its employees that held shares. During his time with the defendant, the plaintiff acquired 30,200 Class A shares and 37,000 Class B shares in the defendant. In 1996, the plaintiff was appointed the Vice President of Marketing and Development and held that position until his termination in July 2005. No additional remuneration was provided under the new title and his duties remained essentially those of a salesperson. The plaintiff was considered a top sales representative of the defendant and focused on supply only contracts. In 2003, one of the plaintiff's sales fell significantly due to the end of one of his supply contracts. In July 2004, the plaintiff was advised in writing that his performance was below expectations and his commission draws would be terminated if his performance did not improve. The plaintiff was advised that he was required to make supply and install sales of $1 million for the year, although he had never achieved supply and install sales at that level. In January 2005, the plaintiff received another letter indicating that his minimum sales target for 2005 was $700,000 and that his commission draws would be terminated in February 2005. The plaintiff advised the defendant one more than one occasion that his sales were down because of poor leads and that he was not getting the number of booked appointments required to reach his sales target. In June 2005, the plaintiff was asked to resign and was ultimately terminated in July 2005. No grounds for termination were cited. The defendant also sought to redeem all of the shares held by the plaintiff in the defendant. The plaintiff had not been paid his commission due to the date of his termination and only received payment three years later. The defendant redeemed the plaintiff's shares and paid him approximately $392,450. The plaintiff was 50 years of age at the time of his dismissal. He was shocked by his dismissal and suffered depression. The plaintiff took several actions to find employment and ultimately found employment. The plaintiff argued that he was entitled to reasonable notice, bonuses, the return of his shares or the value of his shares to the end of the notice period and also sought compensatory damages for mental distress and punitive damages. 	HELD: Action allowed. The plaintiff and the defendant were in an employment-like relationship and the plaintiff was entitled to reasonable notice of termination or payment in lieu of notice. Several factors indicated that the plaintiff was an employee, including the written agreement between the parties, his membership in the employee-only benefits plan, he had been considered a member of the inner management team and was appointed a director, he participated in the employee share ownership plan, virtually all of his income came from his work at the defendant and he did not seek employment from other sources. The defendant had not established just cause to terminate the plaintiff. There was no bad faith or unfair conduct in the plaintiff's dismissal and the plaintiff failed to establish that his mental distress arose from the defendant's conduct as opposed to the dismissal itself. Reasonable notice was 15 months. The plaintiff was entitled to commissions he would have earned during the notice period, a distribution of profit under the employee share ownership plan, a share of the bonus distribution and a redemption price for his shares being the share value determined by the terms of the employee share ownership plan as at December 31, 2005. </summary>
