<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Action by Kasic against Leyh for damages for personal injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident. Leyh admitted liability for the accident, involving his car rear-ending the vehicle operated by Kasic. Kasic was a 50-year-old man who had immigrated to Canada with his wife and two daughters. He was main breadwinner in the family. Prior to the accident, Kasic had worked in manual labour positions that involved heavy work. He was injured on the job prior to the accident and found employment in lighter duty positions. After the accident, his back pain complaints persisted. He moved from job to job, sometimes working full time and sometimes working part time. He was unable to do anything but rest after a full day of work. He underwent several treatment programs and different therapies but his pain did not abate. His earnings remained in the $40,000 range after the accident, and he also received an annual pension due to his workplace injury of $10,500. His family doctor considered Kasic permanently partially disabled. His daughter testified Kasic was not able to perform any household chores or to participate in family activities he enjoyed after the accident, due to pain. His wife and daughter testified to the change in disposition Kasic underwent after the accident. His wife claimed she did not recall Kasic having back problems prior to the accident, and Kasic agreed, but acknowledged a report by his doctor that he experienced short term back problems after a prior motor vehicle accident. A pain management specialist Kasic attended reported his prognosis for recovery was extremely guarded. He reported Kasic had suffered constant pain for three-and-one-half years after the accident, had lost range of motion and had not responded to any therapy or treatment provided. Leyh disputed the long-term nature of Kasic's injuries, noting his employers had no idea he had a back injury and that Kasic had managed to obtain better and better positions over the years following the accident. He also submitted Kasic was understating the impact of the injuries he sustained in the prior motor vehicle accident and wanted damages apportioned between the accidents. 	HELD: Action allowed. Kasic was a truthful witness and his family also provided credible evidence to support his claims of chronic pain. The doctor's report on the prior motor vehicle accident was the only evidence supporting Leyh's claim Kasic had a major pre-existing injury. The court accepted the evidence from Kasic and his wife that any problems arising from the prior accident resolved shortly after that accident. Kasic had a prolonged partial disability. His life changed in many ways after the accident with Leyh. His ability to earn in the future was compromised. His age and condition would detrimentally affect his ability to find a new job if he lost his current one. General damages were assessed at $70,000, special damages of $2,914 and damages for past income loss of $5,441 were agreed to, and damages for future income loss of $100,000 were awarded. </summary>
