<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>This was an application for restoration of the father's rights of access to his two-year-old daughter, interrupted when the mother and child moved to northern Ontario approximately two days travel away from the father's location. The mother and her partner had moved to this location so the partner could find employment in a mine. The mother's family's situation had improved dramatically as a result of the relocation to northern Ontario. The child had been in the custody of her mother all her life, with the exception of a five month period when the father had interim custody. The mother supported the restoration of access but sought to have it exercised in a location near that of the child's residence, at least until she was older. 	HELD: An order was issued that the child would have reasonable access to her father, to be exercised near her new home, unless otherwise arranged by her parents. She would also have reasonable telephone access to her father. The legal system was not designed to shield the non-custodial parent from any change in the custodial parent's life that may affect the exercise of access. A child-centred approach to access required the father to go to the child to exercise access, and to continue to do so until the child demonstrated an ability to tolerate separation from her mother, a sense of security with her father, and an ability to tolerate the stress of long-distance travel. </summary>
