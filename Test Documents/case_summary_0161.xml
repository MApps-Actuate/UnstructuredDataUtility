<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Sentencing of the offender, Hamilton, for sexual assault -- The incidents that gave rise to the conviction occurred 24 years earlier -- At that time, the complainant, age 16, was the girlfriend of the offender's son -- In addition, the offender, age 42, employed the complainant for a two month period to care for his two youngest children while he worked -- During her employment, the complainant stayed with the offender and his family -- She testified that, to her surprise, the offender kissed her while intoxicated -- Subsequently, the offender entered her bedroom and had sexual intercourse with her -- She resisted and the offender told her that he would inform her father that she seduced him if she disclosed the matter -- The complainant testified that non-consensual sexual intercourse occurred on five other occasions -- The complainant, now age 39, filed a victim impact statement that indicated the incidents caused depression, low self-esteem, sexual intimacy issues, and put strain on her marriage -- The offender, now age 65, had no prior convictions and maintained his innocence -- He asked that any sentence be served at home to allow him to support his family and care for his ailing wife -- The offender adduced several letters of good character -- The Crown sought a custodial term of between two and four years -- The offender submitted that a conditional sentence that permitted continued employment was appropriate -- HELD: Hamilton was sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment -- Aggravating factors included the age and vulnerability of the victim, the power imbalance caused by the age disparity and offender's position of authority where the complainant worked and resided, the long-term effects on the victim, and the threat to disclose the incidents to her father -- Mitigating factors included the offender's age and health, his lack of prior criminal record, the absence of alcohol or drug issues, and the offender's otherwise exemplary record as an employee and supportive family member -- Although the offender posed no danger to the community, a conditional sentence was inconsistent with the fundamental principles of sentencing -- Non-consensual sexual intercourse between a 16-year-old girl by a 42-year-old man, and the associated power imbalance, required denunciation and deterrence in clear terms. </summary>
