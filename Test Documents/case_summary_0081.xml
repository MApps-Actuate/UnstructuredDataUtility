<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Action by plaintiff for injuries arising from alleged assault. The plaintiff, who suffered from physical disabilities, was a passenger in a van which was stopped by police. The driver of the vehicle, the plaintiff's husband, was arrested. During the arrest, the plaintiff exited the vehicle and opened the rear of the van to remove her motorized scooter. The position of the plaintiff was that she exited the vehicle in order to urinate and to ensure that her motorized scooter was not taken away with the van. She attempted to drive the scooter to the front of the van along the driver's side of the vehicle, but her path was blocked by several police officers. One of the officers turned the key to the scooter off and the defendant allegedly grabbed the plaintiff and took her to the ground. The plaintiff claimed that there was no legitimate reason for the action taken by the officer, that his actions constituted tortuous assault and battery as he acted in a grossly negligent and malicious manner which resulted in physical injury and humiliation. The position of the officer was that he acted in accordance with his duty and his actions were taken to preserve the plaintiff's life as he believed she was upset and trying to enter the roadway to kill herself. 	HELD: Action dismissed. On a balance of probabilities, it could not be said that the actions of the defendant were dishonest, malicious and negligent or the product of wilful misconduct. It was reasonably possible that the events resulted from miscommunication and misperception between the parties. </summary>
