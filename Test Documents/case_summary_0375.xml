<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application for costs related to a family law dispute between the parties. The applicant argued that she acted in good faith with regard to the ex parte motions. The respondent alleged that the applicant provide full disclosure. The parties each sought costs for the motion for child and spousal support. 	HELD: Application allowed in part. The ex parte motions were not brought in bad faith, but they were inappropriate. The applicant was not entitled to costs relating to work done in bringing the ex parte motion nor for the attendance of counsel before the court to obtain that order. The respondent was entitled to 80% recovery of his costs for the support motion due to the behaviour of the applicant which required the respondent's counsel to undertake unnecessary work. The applicant was awarded one-third of her costs on the support motion as she was successful. The amount owed to the applicant was deducted from the amount owed by the applicant to the respondent. </summary>
