<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Motion by plaintiffs in class proceeding concerning allegedly-criminal payday loans for summary judgment under Rule 20. Meanwhile, the defendants moved for a stay of proceedings under s. 7(1) of the Arbitration Act. The defendants' prior motion for a stay was dismissed, as was an appeal from that order to the Court of Appeal, with leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada being refused in 2005. However, after the action was certified, in July 2007, the Supreme Court released two decisions which the defendants claimed "effectively overturned" the law. The defendants argued that based on these decisions, class proceedings in Ontario were required to give way to arbitration if the representative plaintiff or a class member was bound by an agreement to arbitrate. The court identified six questions raised by the parties' present motions: (1) the nature of the relationship between s. 5(1) of the Class Proceedings Act, which compelled a court to certify an action as a class proceeding when the criteria for certification had been satisfied, and 7(1) Arbitration Act, which compelled a court to stay proceedings when the parties had agreed to submit their dispute to arbitration; (2) whether s. 7 and s. 8 of the Consumer Protection Act, which precluded contracting out of class proceedings, applied retroactively; (3) when a lower court ought to exercise its discretion to allow a party to re-litigate an already-decided issue as a higher court had subsequently changed the law that had been applied to decide it; (4) the significant to Ontario and other common-law provinces of the decisions in Dell Computer Corp. v. Union des consommateurs [2007] 2 S.C.R. 801 and Rogers Wireless Inc. v. Muroff [2007] 2 S.C.R. 921; (5) the extent of a court's jurisdiction in a class proceeding to grant a summary judgment pursuant to Rule 20; and (6) in a payday loan transaction, what counted for interest for the purposes of determining whether a criminal rate of interest had been charged contrary to s. 347 of the Criminal Code. 	HELD: Both motions dismissed. Neither the present court nor the Court of Appeal erred in its general approach to arbitration agreements in the context of class proceedings and the action ought not to be stayed or decertified. Section 7 and s. 8 of the Consumer Protection Act did apply, and the defendants had no right to arbitrate. The arbitration agreements in the Fast Cash Advance Agreements executed between Feb. 2001 and July 20, 2005 were not enforceable. The Ontario legislature made it clear that s. 7 and s. 8 applied retroactively, even if this took away the substantive contract right to have the right to arbitrate and even if the arbitration was actually underway. The defendants' interpretation of the Dell Computer and Rogers Wireless decisions was incorrect. The cases were ultimately just cases about statutory interpretation. The judgments were distinguishable on the issue of the interpretation of the Ontario legislation, as the Ontario statute went farther than the Quebec statute discussed in those decisions. The Ontario statute contained indicia of an intention of a retroactive operation that the Supreme Court found wanting in the Quebec Consumer Protection Act. Subsection 7(1) of the Ontario Act invalidated a term in an agreement insofar as it prevented a consumer from exercising a right to commence an action in court and s. 8(1) empowered a consumer to become a member of a class despite any term in a consumer agreement that has the effect of preventing the consumer from becoming a member of a class proceeding. Furthermore, the defendant Money Mart's right to a stay under s. 7(1) of the Arbitration Act had already been litigated and the matter was now subject to an issue estoppel. The court would not exercise its discretion to relieve against the issue estoppel because in all the circumstances it was not unfair to deny the defendant Money Mart a referral to arbitration. As for the plaintiffs' motion, summary judgment on a common issue or on a few common issues was not objectionable as a matter of jurisdiction under the Rules of Civil Procedure and the Class Proceedings Act, 1992. However, in this case there was a genuine issue for trial concerning whether the charges for the payday loan were "paid for the advancing of credit." The presence of this contested central issue was sufficient to defeat the motion for summary judgment. There was no genuine issue for trial about the constitutionality of s. 347 of the Criminal Code as argued by the defendant, or concerning the "voluntary payment defence" arising from the freedom of the borrower to repay the payday loan in cash. </summary>
