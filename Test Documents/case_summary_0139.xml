<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by Dann, a former young offender, for judicial review of decision of Provincial Archivist refusing to release applicant's files from a youth training center at which he had been a resident -- Applicant required files in negotiating a settlement with Attorney General respecting harm he allegedly suffered at centre -- Archivist argued he was prohibited to release file without court order, as inspection of file by applicant would reveal personal information concerning another person for purposes of s. 10(3)(b) of Archives Act -- Archivist contended that to release the information would be unlawful because s. 126 of Youth Criminal Justice Act provided a complete code in regard to disclosure of records -- HELD: Application allowed -- Archivist's decision quashed -- Youth Criminal Justice Act must be read as a whole and not in disjointed way because it lead to a situation such as present one where neither the "young person" nor his counsel could access his records -- S. 126 did not apply to present situation -- Important to protect privacy of a young person and that was one reason for s. 126, but Youth Criminal Justice Act provided that the young person or his counsel should be able to retrieve his own records. </summary>
