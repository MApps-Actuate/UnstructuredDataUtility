<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Motion by the defendants D'Souza for an order to vary a Mareva order. The plaintiffs had a business selling Internet-based products through wholly-owned websites. The defendant Marc had performed marketing services for the plaintiff, and had his father help in developing payment processes to aid the plaintiffs in managing their cash flow. The plaintiffs realized that they had lost control of their financial resources to Marc, and contended that the defendants retained $48 million of the plaintiff's money. Marc had resigned from the plaintiff's business and had begun an e-commerce site with another defendant. A Mareva order had been issued, freezing the defendants' access to the $48 million. The order had been varied to allow the defendants access to $2.5 million. The defendants were seeking another variation to allow for $600,000 further in funds. The plaintiff took the position that the funds they withdrew should be funded through the e-commerce site Marc had established, rather than through other assets. 	HELD: Motion allowed. To vary a Mareva order, the defendants had to establish that there were no other funds available, that there were assets caught by the injunction that were from a source other than that of the plaintiff's, and that the defendant had exhausted the use of non-proprietary assets frozen by the injunction. The Mareva order had effectively frozen all of the defendants' worldwide assets, but the defendants had failed to establish that there were no assets subject to the injunction that did not have a proprietary claim by the plaintiffs. The defendants had assets available to them in the form of revenue created by the e-commerce site which, while caught by the Mareva order, were not subject to the plaintiff's proprietary claim and was thereby available to fund the defence costs. </summary>
