<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Appeal of conviction for assault. The accused was convicted of assaulting his former partner in a late-night altercation and sentenced to four months in jail. The accused argued that he did not have a lawyer at trial. The accused argued that he had acted in self-defence when he assaulted his former partner. The accused claimed he had no history of violent acts. The accused argued the sentence was inappropriate. The accused claimed he had HIV and did not wish to spend time in prison while ill. 	HELD: Appeal dismissed. There was no legal merit to grounds of appeal. The accused was warned that he should get a lawyer and he did not. The self-defence argument was not supported by the evidence of what was said at trial and had no credibility. There was no evidence that the trial judge took accusations of the accused's history into account. The sentence was not inappropriate given the actions of the accused. Jail authorities could make arrangements for medical treatment. </summary>
