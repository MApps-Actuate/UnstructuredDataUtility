<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>The plaintiffs sued the defendant doctor for damages for having allegedly performed unnecessary surgery to correct the plaintiff's vaginal vault prolapse, and for negligence in the performance of that surgery -- The plaintiff alleged she was unable to work due to the injuries she sustained in the surgery -- She presently suffered from incontinence, requiring catheterization, had occasional flare-ups of pubic pain and she had daily pain in her lower back and coccyx in addition to periodic urinary tract infections -- The plaintiff alleged she had not given informed consent to the surgery -- HELD: The action was dismissed -- The defendant doctor was not negligent in the conduct of the surgery, and his negligence in failing to obtain her informed consent did not cause her injuries -- Based on the evidence, the surgery was found to be the cause of the plaintiff's complaints -- In view of the absence of any note of a discussion that the mesh procedure was developed by the defendant doctor himself and that the plaintiff could use a pessary on a long term basis, the court found he did not provide her with that information -- Therefore the defendant did not tell the plaintiff that surgery was not required if she was prepared to put up with the urinary incontinence she was experiencing and if she was prepared to continue with the pessary on a long-term basis -- In view of the fact that the defendant did not discuss alternatives to surgery and to adequately explain the procedure suggested, the defendant had failed to obtain informed consent -- However, the court was satisfied that a reasonable patient in the plaintiff's circumstances would have decided to have the procedures if she had been properly informed of the nature of the surgery involved, and the risks and the alternatives, meaning the plaintiffs had failed to prove that defendant's negligence in failing to obtain her informed consent caused her injuries -- The surgery was a medically-acceptable solution, which was necessary -- The procedures employed were medically acceptable and the doctor met the standard of care in the performance of the surgery -- The court provisionally assessed damages as including $125,000 for general damages for pain, suffering and loss of enjoyment of life, $11,022 as agreed-upon special damages, $225,000 for lost past income, $235,000 for future lost income, $100,000 for cost of future care, and $70,000 in total family law act claims. </summary>
