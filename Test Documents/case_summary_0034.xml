<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Appeal by the plaintiff, Murray, from an award of $12,000 in non-pecuniary damages and $180 special damages for injuries suffered in a motor vehicle accident. Murray's vehicle was stopped for a red light at an intersection when he was rear ended by Byrd's vehicle. Byrd admitted liability. The trial judge found that Murray sustained a mild soft tissue injury in the accident which essentially cleared within three months. The trial judge refused to allow Murray to call oral opinion evidence from his doctor on the basis that his clinical notes did not meet the written statement requirements of Rule 40A 	HELD: Appeal dismissed. The trial judge's reasons clearly stated his view of the inadequacy of clinical records to delineate the expert opinion from the facts relied on to support that opinion. There were no grounds to disturb the trial judge's award. The award for non-pecuniary damages was not inordinately low, and there was no foundation for any award for loss of future earning capacity. </summary>
