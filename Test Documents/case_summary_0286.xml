<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Motion by respondent Rio Algom Limited for striking out paragraphs from notice of application on ground that Court had no jurisdiction to order wind-up of Pension Plan of Rio -- Applicant was former employee of Rio who contributed to Pension Plan -- Applicant alleged very serious misconduct by Rio in relation to members and beneficiaries of Plan -- Applicant sought relief from Rio's alleged misconduct by winding-up order or by requiring Rio to take steps for winding -up Plan -- HELD: Motion allowed in part -- One paragraph was struck -- Applicant could not ask Court for partial winding-of of Plan as relief essentially required Court to circumvent statutory scheme -- Other relief sought in terms of mandatory injunction requiring Rio to apply for partial wind-up of Plan not precluded -- As relief sought by applicant was premised of finding of wrongdoing on part of Rio, mandamus order might be seen as restorative means of conferring benefits, if not rights themselves, inherent to those rights infringed upon -- Assuming finding were made that there was breach of Plan members' rights, Court was best forum to determine which remedy was best suited to respond to finding of unlawful actions. </summary>
