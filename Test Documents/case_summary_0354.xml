<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by Bulls Eye for an oppression remedy. Bulls Eye operated a restaurant located in a plaza owned by Select. In June 2003, Select terminated the lease with Bulls Eye, prompting Bulls Eye to seek a declaration of wrongful termination and damages for the breach. On February 18, 2004, Bulls Eye was granted partial summary judgment in its favour, confirming that the termination was wrongful. That decision was upheld on appeal and the damages trial was held on June 30, 2006, when judgment was rendered in favour of Bulls Eye in the amount of $699,465. Although Select appealed the judgment, the appeal was quashed. Payment of the judgment and appeal costs remained outstanding. On July 19, 2005, the plaza was sold for $10,225,000. The net proceeds amounted to $3,818,132, all of which was paid directly to the respondent McLennan, the owner of Select. Select did not receive any funds from the proceeds of the sale of the plaza, which was its only asset. Prior to the sale of the plaza, Bulls Eye attempted to protect the assets of Select by bringing a motion seeking the appointment of a receiver to complete the sale and to control the proceeds of the sale. However, that motion was dismissed. McLennan took the position that Select owed her a debt and that the monies she received from Select were as a creditor only and were received before Bulls Eye became a creditor. Bulls Eye took the position that McLennan left a judgment creditor, Bulls Eye, without the ability to enforce its judgment. 	HELD: Application allowed. Bulls Eye became a creditor when it obtained summary judgment in its favour on February 18, 2004. Although Bulls Eye was not yet a judgment creditor, it had and was entitled to have an expectation that sufficient funds would be held such that Bulls Eye could expect to recover on its judgment. Furthermore, McLennan failed to establish on a balance of probabilities that the alleged debts were enforceable obligations against Select. Therefore, Bulls Eye was entitled to priority of its judgment. </summary>
