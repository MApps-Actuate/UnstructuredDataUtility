<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Action in tort and contract by the widow and son of a man who died while participating in a scuba diving course for damages related to the loss of the deceased's care, guidance and companionship. The plaintiffs also claimed damages for the past and future loss of his financial support, for the loss of his household services, and for funeral expenses. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants owed a duty of care to the deceased to provide competent and professional diving instruction. The plaintiffs also alleged that the defendant Kanata Diving Supply had a contractual obligation to the deceased, including the requirement to rent to him diving equipment in good working order and suitable for the requirements of each dive. The deceased signed a release from liability form prior to making the dive. 	HELD: Action dismissed. Despite breaches of the standard of care by the dive company and the dive leader and contractual breaches by the company, the valid contractual Release of Liability signed by the deceased operated as a bar to the plaintiffs' claims. The bar operated in relation to claims in tort and contract and under the Family Law Act. </summary>
