<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Trial of accused charged with four counts of sexual offences against two minor females. The accused was charged with two counts of sexual assault against K.R., aged six at the time of the alleged incidents, and two counts of sexual assault against R.P., aged 13 at the time of the alleged incidents. The accused, his wife and their two children moved into the multi-unit residential complex in which the complainants also resided. When the accused and his wife separated, the accused remained living in the complex and developed relationships and friendships within the complex and, in particular, developed a close relationship with one of his neighbours and K.R.'s family. K.R. disclosed to her father and later testified that the accused made her feel his penis almost every time she went over to his house and sometimes put his penis against her bum. The complainant R.P. became involved with the accused as a babysitter for his children. She alleged that she went over to his place three or four times a week to socialize with him, but usually to babysit and alleged that he would try to kiss her, feel her breasts and get in her pants. She also alleged that the accused would buy her cigarettes and give her alcohol. R.P. described herself as a chronic runaway and admitted to drinking and trying a number of drugs. The accused denied the allegations of both complainants, but testified to three occasions on which the complainant K.R. had touched his crouch while sitting in his lap. He indicated that on each occasion the touching was unprovoked by him and he immediately sent the child to play with his children. He further testified that he did not mention the incidents to anyone as he did not know how to bring it up. In addition, the accused denied ever being alone with either complainant except for two occasions when K.R. came over to pick up some sweets which his wife had left for the children. 	HELD: Accused acquitted. The accused was a credible witness and the complainants were not. The fact that R.P. was a chronic runaway and admitted drug user had some effect on her credibility. Her testimony read like a script, was rife with generalizations and short on particulars of the alleged incidents. There was no corroboration of the evidence of K.R. and her evidence was unfocussed except when asked leading questions. </summary>
