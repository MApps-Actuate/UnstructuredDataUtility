<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>This was an application to separately assess four buildings. The applicants owned adjoining buildings collectively identified as Parkway Place. Under the Commercial Concentration Tax Act, a single commercial property containing two or more buildings not dependent on shared facilities were to be separately assessed. Owners were subject to taxation if the premises were over 18,600 square metres in area. There were no ground floor connections to any of the buildings but they were connected by a pedestrian walkway on the second level which included a common lunch area. Each had a separate lobby entrance. One roadway at the back of the buildings provided vehicular and loading access to the separate loading docks and parking. A single basement shipping and receiving area was located under the buildings. 	HELD: The application was allowed. The four buildings were "a taxable commercial property" within section 3(1) of the Act. There were such connections between the four properties in terms of ownership, operation and physical structure that there was unity. They were also "a single commercial property" which contained two or more buildings within section 2 of the Act. The only shared facility was the walkway which constituted a common mall. The shipping and receiving areas were not shared even though there was common vehicle access. However, the buildings were not "dependent" on the shared facility in that the existence of the buildings was not contingent on it. </summary>
