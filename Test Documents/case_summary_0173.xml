<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by the intended appellant, State Farm Mutual Insurance Company, for a determination as to whether leave to appeal was required in the circumstances of the case in respect of a decision of the Court of Queen's Bench. The Court of Queen's Bench had held that the Federal Court was the appropriate forum for dealing with the applicant's request for declaratory relief involving the constitutional validity of federal legislation touching on the powers of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada. 	HELD: Application allowed. It was settled law that an order that had the effect of bringing proceedings to an end was a final order, even if the merits of the case remained to be decided in another forum. Accordingly, an order staying proceedings brought in one forum (New Brunswick) and forcing the party to pursue relief in another (Federal Court) qualified as a final order. Therefore, the applicant did not require leave in this case. </summary>
