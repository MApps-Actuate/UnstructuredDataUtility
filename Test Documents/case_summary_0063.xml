<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Appeal by the plaintiff vendor, Close, and cross-appeal by the defendant purchaser, Weigh West Marine Resort, from a summary trial judgment determining the final price for the purchase and sale of shares in the capital of West Close Holdings. The vendor owned West Close. West Close carried on the Weigh West Marine business. The vendor agreed to sell the business via a sale in the shares in the capital of West Close to L. Under the resultant agreement, L assigned its rights as purchaser to Weigh West. The parties agreed on a price of approximately $8 million. The share purchase agreement provided for payment of the purchase price, subject to three types of specific adjustment to reflect assumed indebtedness, net changes in the book value of assets and liabilities, and seasonal preparation costs for the portion of the fiscal year prior to closing. The parties recognized that portions of the adjustments would be dependent upon information received post-closing and contemplated a holdback of a portion of the purchase price. Post-closing, the purchaser took exception to the calculation of the book value adjustment on the basis that it was not prepared in accordance with past accounting practice, and overstated the seasonal preparation costs. The vendor sued to recover $128,651 it contended it was owed from the holdback. The summary trial judge found in favour of the purchaser and awarded the vendor $79,655. The judge ordered each party to bear its own costs on the basis of divided success. The judge also found that the vendor was entitled to pre-judgment interest from the day on which the purchaser took the position of the amount it owed from the holdback. The parties appealed. 	HELD: Appeal allowed in part and cross-appeal dismissed. It was open to the defendant purchaser to challenge the calculation of the book value adjustment, as the agreement required the financial statements to be prepared with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis consistent with prior years. There was no basis for interference with the summary trial judge's finding that the statements were not prepared in such manner based on the expert accounting opinions in evidence. The purchaser was not estopped from disputing the adjustment for seasonal preparation costs post-closing, as the plaintiff vendor could not be viewed as having acted to his detriment by fulfilling his legal obligation to complete the transaction. However, the provisions related to holdback made no provision for readjustment of seasonal preparation costs post-closing unless it related to a breach of a representation, warranty, covenant, or constituted a mutual mistake. No such breach or mistake occurred. Thus the vendor was entitled to the balance of the holdback, $103,165, based on the relevant adjustment as at closing. No error was made in respect of the award of pre-judgment interest, or the exercise of discretion in relation to the award of costs. </summary>
