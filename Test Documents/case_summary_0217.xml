<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>This was an application for determination of a question of law, namely, whether the plaintiff's claims were statute-barred by reason of the three-month limitation contained in s. 284(2) of the Municipal Act. The plaintiff's claims resulted from serious injuries suffered when she lost control of her car on a very icy portion of a road on December 29, 1986. The action was commenced on March 31, 1987, more than three months after the accident. The action was for non-repair of the highway. The issue was whether the limitation provision was invalid because it violated s. 15 of the Charter which protected equality rights. 	HELD: The action was statute-barred and therefore dismissed. The application of s. 284(2) did not depend on any personal characteristic of the plaintiff. The plaintiff had argued that the section violated the Charter because the three-month period included only 90 days in the circumstances of this case whereas it could include as many as 92 days where the period did not include the month of February. The section did not violate the Charter. </summary>
