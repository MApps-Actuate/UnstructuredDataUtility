<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by the accused for judicial interim release pending his appeal from conviction and sentence for conspiracy to traffic in cocaine. The accused had applied for a stay of proceedings. The trial judge dismissed the application on the ground that the applicant failed to establish sufficient prejudice to counter the high societal interest in bringing this matter to trial. The applicant argued that the trial judge erred in refusing a stay of proceedings in that he did not apply the correct test. The applicant's parents resided in British Columbia and he was in a stable relationship. The applicant had a child in British Columbia and grew up there. He presented himself as required when on bail throughout the lengthy interim between being charged and the trial. 	HELD: Application dismissed. Although the applicant's ties to the community and his compliance with the previous bail conditions were factors in favour of the applicant, they did not establish, in the circumstances of the case, that the interests of justice favoured the applicant's release pending appeal. There was some force to the contention that the trial judge did not perfectly articulate the test for a stay of proceedings based upon delay. However, it was also not immediately apparent that this was a strong case for a stay of proceedings. </summary>
