<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Munyaneza was charged under the Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act with seven counts of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. Munyaneza chose to proceed before a judge without a jury. A rogatory commission was held in Kigali, Rwanda, so that the Court could hear the first 14 prosecution witnesses. The Prosecution's other 16 witnesses were heard in Montreal. Munyaneza presented 36 defence witnesses. The Act provided that a person who has committed abroad a crime of genocide, a crime against humanity or a war crime could be prosecuted in Canada if he or she resided here. The first two counts alleged that Munyaneza committed an act of genocide by intentionally killing and causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of an identifiable group of people, the Tutsi. Counts three and four alleged that Munyaneza committed crimes against humanity by intentional killing and acts of sexual violence. Counts five, six and seven alleged that Munyaneza committed war crimes by means of intentional killing, acts of sexual violence and pillage. Munyaneza was among the people in charge of the city of Butare. Prosecution witnesses, many of whom knew Munyaneza since childhood, testified that he beat victims, recruited young militiamen for the Interahamwe to kill Tutsi, distributed weapons to them, set up road blocks where Tutsi were killed, plundered residences, raped numerous Tutsi women, ordered the killings of many Tutsi and personally killed refugees using a gun, a knife or a stick. Several of these witnesses stated that they recognized Munyaneza by a scar on his face, by his military uniform and by the vehicle he drove. The defence witnesses testified that Munyaneza did not participate in the genocide and several of them denied that the genocide ever reached Butare. Munyaneza did not testify. The Prosecution argued that all the elements constituting the offences were demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt. The defence pleaded that there was a conspiracy among the Prosecution witnesses against the accused, as well as against his family. 	HELD: Guilty verdict on all counts. Section 6(3) of the Act defined genocide as an act or omission committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, an identifiable group of persons, as such, that at the time and in the place of its commission, constituted genocide within the meaning of customary international law or conventional international law or by virtue of its being criminal according to the general principles of law recognized by the community of nations. The perpetrator of the crime of genocide had to have a specific intent to destroy a group in whole or in part because of its national, ethnic, racial or religious nature. Rape, sexual violence, mutilation and interrogation accompanied by blows or threats were recognized as acts causing serious physical harm. Subjecting a person to intense fear, terror, intimidation or threats was recognized as an act causing serious mental harm. Rape and sexual violence constituted serious bodily or mental harm to a person and, therefore, were acts constituting genocide if they were committed with the intent to destroy the group to which the victim belonged. In international law, genocide required the Prosecution to demonstrate that the accused had the specific intent to destroy the victim's ethnic group in whole or in part. The perpetrator of the crime of genocide had to have had the intent to physically destroy the targeted group, not only its national, linguistic, religious or cultural identity. In 1994, the Tutsi of Rwanda formed an identifiable ethnic group. For genocide to be demonstrated, the intent to destroy that drove the perpetrators of the crime had to be specifically motivated by the very nature of the group to which the victims belonged. Concerning the counts of genocide, the Prosecution had to prove that, in addition to being systematic, the attacks were directed against a civilian population that was the primary, not merely a collateral, object of the attack. The elements essential to intentional killing were the same in a context of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. For a war crime to be proven, there had to be an armed conflict and the prohibited act had to be related to it. It was demonstrated, and it was not contested, that a non-international armed conflict occurred in Rwanda between April 1 and July 31, 1994. Between 1990 and 1994, many Tutsi were massacred throughout Rwanda on all manner of pretexts and, generally, with complete impunity. Close to one million people were killed. The 1994 conflict was between the RAF and the RPF. The Prosecution witnesses were credible, while there were many contradictions in the testimony of defence witnesses. Many of them had no credibility, and others never left their compounds during the period of the massacres and could not provide any useful testimony. Several defence witnesses seemed to deny that a genocide occurred. There were no reason to objectively believe that the versions of prosecution witnesses were not trustworthy in terms of the specific facts related, the evidence of which was damning for Munyaneza. It was established beyond a reasonable doubt that Munyaneza was indeed the person referred to by the Prosecution witnesses. The evidence showed beyond a reasonable doubt that Munyaneza participated in the hunting down of Tutsi and was at the forefront of the genocidal movement. The evidence showed beyond a reasonable doubt that his vehicles were used to commit violent acts against Tutsi, that he distributed arms and uniforms to Interahamwe so that they would attack Tutsi, that he looted homes and businesses while armed, that he forced dozens of Tutsi detained at roadblocks to get into his pick-up, took them to a common pit and took part in their murder, that he was among the assailants who killed hundreds of Tutsi refugees at the Ngoma church, that he raped, and took part in the sexual assault of, dozens of Tutsi women, that he made the Tutsi refugees suffer the worst cruelties and that he beat to death with sticks children tied up in sacks. Through his social status and his determination, Munyaneza participated actively in the plan as Interahamwe leader and as a member of the local elite who implemented the elements of what was to become genocide. Munyaneza's criminal intent was demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt, as was his culpable violence. Munyaneza specifically intended to destroy the Tutsi ethnic group in Butare and in the surrounding communes. To that end, he intentionally killed Tutsi, seriously wounded others, caused them serious physical and mental harm, sexually assaulted many Tutsi women and generally treated Tutsi inhumanely and degradingly. In doing so, he committed the crime of genocide according to the Act. Munyaneza intentionally murdered many Tutsi, a clearly identifiable part of the civilian population of Butare and the surrounding communes, knowing that his acts were part of a widespread and systematic attack encouraged and supported by the government, the army, the Interahamwe, the local elites of which he was a part, and a portion of the civilian population. In the same circumstances and with the same wrongful intent, he committed numerous acts of sexual violence against Tutsi. In doing so, he committed a crime against humanity according to the Act. While an armed national conflict raged in Rwanda between the RAF and the RPF, Munyaneza intentionally killed dozens of people in Butare and the surrounding communes who were not participating directly in the conflict, sexually assaulted dozens of people and looted the homes and businesses of individuals who had nothing to do with the armed conflict, thereby committing a war crime according to the Act. </summary>
