<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Sentencing of the offender, CBH, following conviction for assault and sexual assault. The accused, age 28, ceased a five year relationship in which he fathered two children. He became involved with another woman that had three children. While caring for the children, the accused physically and sexually assaulted the woman's oldest daughter, age four. The victim testified at trial and stated that the assaults were committed on several occasions during a three month period, always at night while the mother slept in another room. The assaults were invasive and caused severe physical damage to the victim's genital region. The assaults ended when the children were removed by social services after the youngest child died from neglect. The offender had an extensive criminal record that included convictions for assault. He was apparently a victim of sexual assault at the age of eight. The accused took responsibility for the offences, but denied any wrongdoing. He claimed that he was trying to educate the victim about the dangers of sexual exploitation, and that the victim was seeking retribution for her sister's death. The victim, now age seven, filed an impact statement that included words and drawing indicating the fear she experienced due to the offences. The victim's foster mother also filed an impact statement describing the devastating emotional consequences on the victim. 	HELD: CBH was sentenced to a custodial term of six years and eight months. Statutorily deemed aggravating factors included the age of the victim and the offender's abuse of his position of trust in relation to the victim. Further aggravating factors included the age of the offender, his prior criminal record, his limited remorse, the gravity and violence of the offences, the long-term effect on the victim, and threats of reprisals by the offender. Mitigating factors included the age of the offender and his difficult childhood. Given the nature of the offence, deterrence and denunciation were of paramount importance. </summary>
