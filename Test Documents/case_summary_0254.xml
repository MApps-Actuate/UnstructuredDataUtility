<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by Anne Wilson for arrears of child support from Douglas Wilson for the child, Douglas Jr., born December 23, 1982, for the period from July 2001 to July 2002. During that period, Douglas Jr. took an extra year of high school because he felt he was not ready to enter university. The parties had entered Minutes of Settlement but they contained no express provisions as to the duration of child support. Anne earned income of $23,000. Douglas netted $240,000 during 2001 from his dental practice. Douglas Jr. was unmarried, but was over the age of 18. The school's standard operating procedures provided that a student who was taking six or more courses was considered to be a full-time student. Douglas Jr. took four courses out of a possible full course load of eight. He was involved in two school bands throughout the year. One, for which he got a credit, practiced three times a week. He also played in the school jazz band which practiced twice weekly. Douglas Jr. attended school every day and went to between one and three classes each day. A maximum course load would consist of four classes each day, although six courses would require less than four classes each day. Douglas Jr. was not pursuing any pastimes other than his schooling until he obtained a part-time job in March of 2002. 	HELD: Application allowed and Douglas was ordered to pay to Anne arrears of child support, fixed at $17,549. Douglas Jr. was fully engaged in his schooling during the 2001-2002 school year, attended each day for the bulk of the day, and participated in a meaningful way with the purposes and objectives of his program. Participation in the school bands could be seen as an educational experience offered by the school that was supplementary to the classroom education in music that he received. Considering one band practice each day to be the educational equivalent of one class each day, then for practical purposes Douglas Jr. was taking the equivalent of two to four classes each day, a load that would be roughly consistent with the load that a student taking six courses would be carrying. Accordingly, he was enroled in a full-time program of education and Anne was entitled to continue receiving child support on his behalf. </summary>
