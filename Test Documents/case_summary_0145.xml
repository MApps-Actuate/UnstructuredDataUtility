<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>The applicants appealed a reviewing officer's decision in which he refused to review certain lawyer's bills on the grounds that there were no special circumstances to justify a review where he was precluded from acting, as the bills had been paid and no notice of review had been served within 90 days of payment as provided for under s. 85(9)(d) of the Law Society Act -- HELD: The appeal was dismissed with $2,000 in costs, save with respect to seven bills which were referred back to the officer for review -- The court was unable to find any error in principle in the reviewing officer's observation that were the facts as alleged by the applicants found to be true, he would not have seen special circumstances to be established -- The officer had, however, erred with respect to seven of the bills, as none of them had been paid by the applicants, meaning the officer did err in principle by refusing to review them as to all the applicants -- To the extent that he limited the review of these bills to only to Applicants who had not been billed prior to the litigation, the appeal was to be allowed and the bills were to be referred back to the reviewing officer for review as they pertained to all the Applicants on this appeal. </summary>
