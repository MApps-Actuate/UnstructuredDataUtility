<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Petition by the City for costs following its successful application for an injunction requiring the Falun Gong to remove structures placed on a City street. The structures were found to have violated a City bylaw. The argument the removal of the structures would violate the rights of the Falun Gong members to freedom of expression was rejected, because of the manner of expression was incompatible with the fundamental purpose of the street and was therefore not protected. The City was not found to have acted for an improper purpose in enforcing its bylaw. 	HELD: Petition allowed. Costs were to follow the event. The case was not public interest in nature and did not raise any novel issues of law. The Falun Gong members had a direct personal interest in the outcome. There had already been a judicial determination that obstructing City sidewalks in breach of the bylaw was not a form of protected expression. There was no evidence presented by the Falun Gong members that they lacked the ability to pay costs. They made the proceedings necessary by refusing to remove their structures, despite several previous requests from the City. </summary>
