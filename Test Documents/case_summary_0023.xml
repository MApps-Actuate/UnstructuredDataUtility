<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Sentencing of Wolfe following his guilty pleas to assault with a weapon, common assault, and three breaches of recognizance. The complainant in the assaults was Wolfe's spouse, Rozak. Rozak called 911 one night when the pair were drinking together at a hotel, after they argued and Wolfe put his hands around her throat. She returned to the hotel room after making the call and locked herself in the bathroom. Wolfe used a steak knife to open the bathroom door and walked toward Rozak with the knife in his hand. Wolfe had little memory of the evening because of his level of intoxication, and he accepted that Rozak had a better recollection of what happened. He conceded possession of the knife, but there was no evidence he did anything else with it. In the course of providing a statement to the police, Rozak mentioned two other incidents of assault, which gave rise to the common assault charge. In the first, Wolfe grabbed her and pulled her hair, and in the second, he slammed her into a wall and held her against the wall with her jaw, resulting in bruising to her chest. Wolfe was released pending his sentencing on certain conditions. He failed to attend the required spousal assault counselling and was twice discovered intoxication, in contravention of conditions of his release. He also went AWOL from the residence where he was required to live, and eventually turned himself in, He spent 81 days on remand prior to sentencing. Wolfe had an extensive criminal record including convictions for related offences in the context of a prior relationship, and process-related offences. He was a 32-year-old who had been abused as a child and had been involved with the criminal justice system since the age of 16. He had been abusing alcohol since he was 19 years old and abused other substances as well. He had a GED and aspired to return to school to eventually find a more stable job. His inability to complete the spousal abuse program resulted from his inability to stay away from alcohol. The Crown sought an additional sentence of three to six months' imprisonment and 12 to 18 months probation. The defence sought a sentence of time served and more probation. 	HELD: Wolfe was sentenced to serve an additional two months' imprisonment and 12 months' probation, under conditions including abstinence, attending drug, alcohol and spousal abuse counselling, and staying away from Rozak. He was also ordered to provide a DNA sample. It was clear from his record that Wolfe had some issues with respect to compliance with court orders. His guilty plea and the work he did in the spousal abuse program were both mitigating factors. </summary>
