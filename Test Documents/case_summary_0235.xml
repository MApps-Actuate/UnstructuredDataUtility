<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>This was an application to quash an order to stand trial on a charge of conspiracy to traffic in cocaine. At the preliminary inquiry, the judge refused to permit cross-examination on an affidavit filed in support of an application for judicial authorization to intercept private communications. The applicants argued that the refusal constituted a jurisdictional error. 	HELD: The application was dismissed. Cross-examination at a preliminary inquiry was a matter of discretion. To find that it was a matter of right would be anomalous where the primary evidence could not be excluded for unconstitutional conduct at a preliminary inquiry. The primary basis upon which the applicants were denied the right to cross-examine on the affidavit was that they failed to satisfy the requirements to obtain leave to do so. The right to cross-examine the prosecutor's witnesses at the preliminary inquiry, as at trial, was subject to the fundamental evidentiary principles of relevance, materiality and admissibility. </summary>
