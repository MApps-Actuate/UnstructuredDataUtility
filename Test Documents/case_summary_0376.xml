<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Motion by Vivian Assaf to set aside notices of garnishment relating to funds the court had directed the Accountant to pay out to Assaf. All the assets of Assaf's late husband's estate had been liquidated and the proceeds paid into court. Under the will of her husband, Assaf was entitled to an annual payment, which was $24,000 at the time of the hearing. In 2004 Assaf was ordered to pay costs of $20,000 to the Estate of Robert Bosada (Estate) and $15,000 to Bernard Burton. The Estate of Robert Bosada and Bernard Burton issued Notices of Garnishment directed to the Accountant. 	HELD: Motion allowed. The $24,000 the court authorized the Accountant to pay out to Assaf was not a "debt payable" under Rule 60.08(1). Rule 72.05 and section 23 of the Creditors' Relief Act provided mechanisms by which a judgement creditor could seek to execute on the monies held in court. </summary>
