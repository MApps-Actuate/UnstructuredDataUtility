<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by the plaintiff mortgagee for summary judgment. The plaintiff sued for monies owing on a promissory note and mortgage. The defendant argued that the plaintiff failed to mitigate its damages by not selling the unit for three years after the default. 	HELD: Application granted. The defendant's liability was not limited by the Non-Recourse Agreement. Once the power of sale had matured, the mortgagee was entitled to exercise it whenever he chose to do so. The mere lapse of three years did not prove lack of good faith or default. </summary>
