<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Action by the 11-year-old plaintiff Lloyd against the defendants Austin and Rutter for damages for injuries arising when Lloyd was struck by a motor vehicle driven by Austin and owned by Rutter. Lloyd was walking home from school. He looked both ways before stepping off the curb onto the street. He was not at a crosswalk. He failed to notice Austin's vehicle approaching, although his view was unobstructed. Lloyd's head made contact with the windshield of Austin's vehicle. Austin was an inexperienced and unlicensed driver. He knew the area was close to a school and that it was the end of the school day. He was driving within the speed limit. He saw Lloyd at the side of the road and made eye contact with him before the accident. Only liability was to be determined. 	HELD: Action allowed in part. Lloyd was negligent in the manner he chose to cross the street and proceeded before it was safe to do so. Austin failed to take appropriate steps to avoid the accident. A prudent driver would have proceeded very cautiously, honked the horn or stopped. Austin had a duty to have his vehicle under control such that he could stop it within a distance at which he could see pedestrians on a street that he knew or ought to have known that pedestrians crossed. Austin misinterpreted the eye contact he had with Lloyd and failed to respond adequately. Austin was 30 per cent liable for the accident. Lloyd was 70 per cent responsible for his contribution to the accident. </summary>
