<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Appeal by the plaintiff from a decision of a chambers judge confirming a Master's decision refusing to allow portions of the statement of claim that alleged breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and negligence against the respondent university in not following its internal review procedure and breach of privacy. The appellant had received a failing grade in a teaching practicum course he took at the respondent. He unsuccessfully appealed the grade through the respondent's internal review process. Judicial review of the respondent's decision was refused. The appellant then commenced the present action, which raised many of the same issues raised on the judicial review application. The respondent successfully had the statement of claim struck out. On appeal the court allowed the claims of breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and negligence to proceed but struck out those claims which had already been determined on the judicial review application. The appellant then sought to file an amended statement of claim alleging the respondent failed to follow its internal review procedure and that the respondent violated his privacy rights by informing the media he had not been a student at the respondent subsequent to receiving the failing grade. The Master considered himself bound by the Court of Appeal's previous decision which upheld the decision to strike allegations which essentially were identical to those in the proposed amended statement of claim. The chambers judge agreed with this conclusion. 	HELD: Appeal dismissed. The appellant had previously pleaded the respondent failed properly to follow internal procedures and the Court of Appeal struck the allegation on the basis the legality of the process followed by the respondent was finally determined in the judicial review litigation. The chambers judge made no error confirming the Master was not in error in considering he was bound by that decision. In his consideration of the breach of privacy claim the chambers judge made no reviewable error. There was no common-law claim for breach of privacy. The claim must rest on the provisions of the Privacy Act. The issue between the parties no longer was confidential and the respondent's discussion of information concerning it was clearly in the context of this litigation. It was not a violation of privacy. Taking into account the circumstances of the alleged disclosure, placed in the context of the ongoing dispute between the parties, the material before the Court did not support the notion the alleged disclosure was wilful and without a claim of right. The privacy claim did not have an air of reality and the chambers judge did not err in refusing to allow it to proceed. </summary>
