<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Determination of costs of two interlocutory motions. The plaintiff Bayerische Landesbank Gironzentrale's motion to set aside the registrar's dismissal of the action was allowed. The defendant Sieber's motion for discharge of a certificate of pending litigation was dismissed. The plaintiff's claim had been dismissed by the registrar for failure to meet court deadlines. The plaintiff's set aside motion was opposed by all defendants. The plaintiff sought costs of the set aside motion on a partial indemnity scale in the amount of $32,219. The plaintiff sought substantial indemnity costs of the discharge motion in the amount of $123,775. The plaintiff claimed legal fees including 250 hours of lawyer time and 122 hours of student and clerk time on the discharge motion, and 91 hours of lawyer time and 62 hours of student and clerk time on the set aside motion. The defendants argued that there should be no costs of either motion, or that costs should be limited to $15,000 for the discharge motion. 	HELD: Costs of $25,000 awarded to the plaintiff for the discharge motion. Costs were on a partial indemnity basis. This was a reasonable costs award and within the expectations of the defendants. The motions were complex and required significant preparation and review. However, the legal fees claimed by the plaintiff were excessive and included considerable duplication of effort by two senior lawyers. There would be no costs ordered for the plaintiff's set aside motion. The action was dismissed by the registrar due to the plaintiff's actions in deliberately missing court deadlines. </summary>
