<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by the Crown to introduce documents into evidence in the accused Daley's trial for tax evasion and false statements -- The accused was charged under the Excise Tax Act -- The Crown sought to enter taxation documents from the Quebec department of revenue, verified by the affidavit of a Quebec government employee -- The accused objected on the grounds that the affiant was not an officer of the agency as required in s. 335 of the Act -- The Crown also sought to enter a printout of a GST registration search; the accused argued that the printout was not a document within the meaning of the Act and therefore not admissible -- The accused opposed the admission of bank documents on the grounds that the affiant claimed that they "appeared to be" true copies -- Further documents, while stamped as true copies, lacked one of two necessary attestations to that effect, as required by the Canada Evidence Act -- HELD: Application allowed in part -- The GST registration search printout was a document and therefore admissible under s. 335 -- The tax documents were not admissible, as they were not accompanied by an affidavit by an officer of the agency -- The bank records were not admissible as the affidavit was equivocal and did not establish that they were true copies -- The authentication procedures had not been complied with. </summary>
