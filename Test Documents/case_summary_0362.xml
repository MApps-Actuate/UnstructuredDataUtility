<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application to re-locate child. The parties had been the parents of a 6-year-old child. The parties had separated in 2004, and the plaintiff mother had remarried. The separation agreement provided for an equitable schedule for the care of the child. The plaintiff mother brought the application to move both herself and the child to Halifax, where her husband was pursuing a business opportunity. The father defendant contended that the plaintiff had wanted to move to Halifax since their separation, and there was a mobility restriction in place in their agreement unless there was consent by both parties or if a court ordered the move. The child had some developmental delay issues and behavioral challenges, and had been enrolled in a school system designed to meet his needs. 	HELD: Application dismissed. The primary consideration in mobility cases was the best interests of the child, and not the rights or interests of the parents. The evidence showed that both parties were loving and committed parents who provided excellent care for the child. The Divorce Act held that children were to be given as much contact with each parent as was consistent with the child's best interests. There was no combination of time for the father to see the child that could provide the child with the same quality of relationship. The primary reason for the move was a business opportunity for the mother's husband, which could be pursued without completely altering the child's relationship with the father. The evidence submitted showed that the child was thriving in his present environment with all the resources and supports that were in place for him. It was in the child's best interests to continue in the environment he was currently in with his parents who were equally involved in his life. </summary>
