<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by the husband to enforce a consent order, to obtain a declaration the wife was not entitled to a survivor benefit from the husband's estate, and to direct his pension administrator to transfer post-survivor benefits to the couple's children upon the death of either party. The parties were divorced in 2007 after a 14-year marriage. The husband retired in 1996 and was receiving a pension. He had amassed 32 years of pension time, to which the wife was entitled to 3 years. He elected to have survivorship benefits paid to his wife when he retired. Under the terms of the consent order, the wife was to continue to receive her proportionate share of the husband's pension but relinquished all survivor benefits. The pension administrator agreed to pay the wife her proportionate share of the husband's pension but declined to recognize her waiver of survivorship benefits. The wife claimed she was pressured into signing away her rights. 	HELD: Application allowed in part. In order for the wife's waiver of survivorship benefits to be effective upon the administrator, it had to have been made prior to the commencement of the pension. The wife was ordered to receive the benefits in trust for the husband's beneficiaries, the children. </summary>
