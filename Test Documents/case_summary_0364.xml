<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Action for personal injuries suffered in a slip and fall accident causing a severe fracture of the plaintiff's right femur. The plaintiff's leg twisted and slid out from under her as she slipped on a muddy concrete slurry substance that had pooled on the sidewalk. The plaintiff alleged that the substance originated from the store owned by the defendants Wang and Huang. Wang had repaired some of the cement in front of the store prior to the accident. The sidewalk was owned and maintained by the defendant City. At the time of the accident, the plaintiff, 52, worked full-time as a cashier. She claimed her injuries prevented her from returning to her job and from obtaining any other work. Due to the accident, the plaintiff continued to suffer severe knee pain that prevented her from standing for long periods. Her activity level was down 50 per cent than it was prior to the accident. As a direct consequence of the accident, she experienced a significant acceleration of osteoarthritis in her knees that caused her enormous pain and disability of function that required her to undergo one knee replacement surgery. 	HELD: Action allowed. Wang and Huang were 80 per cent liable in nuisance and negligence. By washing the concrete residue off his property and onto the City sidewalk, Wang created a concrete slurry which pooled on the sidewalk on which the plaintiff slipped. Wang was negligent as he breached his duty of care to prevent injury to those using the sidewalk from substances emanating from his property. The City was 20 per cent liable since it failed to keep the sidewalk in a reasonable state of repair. The newer concrete slabs at the accident site sloped towards the properties rather than away which did not comply with applicable construction standard. This part's state relative to the older abutting sidewalk slabs left at least one trip ledge present that violated the City's own inspection and maintenance standard. These conditions of non-repair, conditions that the City knew existed, created a sidewalk condition that permitted the concrete slurry to become trapped when it pooled on the sidewalk. It was the accumulation of that slurry in that location that was caused by the condition of non-repair of the sidewalk that caused the plaintiff's fall. The City's policy of inspection was inadequate. Non-pecuniary damages for pain, suffering and loss of enjoyment of life of $120,000 were awarded. Considering the permanent effect the plaintiff's injuries had on her husband as the spouses were no longer able to enjoy the same activities they did prior to the accident and the husband was required to perform many household chores the plaintiff was no longer able to do, his Family Law Act damages were assessed at $20,000. The plaintiff's inflation adjusted annual average earnings prior to the accident was $24,390. Due to her pre-accident health problems, she would unlikely have been employed full-time until age 63. A fair assessment of her past and future income loss must assume both full and part-time employment to age 61. Her past and future loss of income was assessed at $190,000. This amount was discounted by 10 per cent for failure to mitigate. Although the plaintiff had very limited job prospects after the accident, she failed to explore any other opportunities. </summary>
