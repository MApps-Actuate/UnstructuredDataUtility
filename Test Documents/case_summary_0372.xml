<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Costs endorsement after defendants were successful on a motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff did not meet the subsequent court-mandated timeline for delivery of costs submissions. The defendants sought $60,577 in substantial indemnity costs plus $4,377 in disbursements. The plaintiff countered by suggesting $8,505 in partial indemnity costs plus $1,000 in disbursements. 	HELD: Defendant True North Corporation awarded substantial indemnity cots of $22,500 plus $4,377 for disbursements plus GST. There would be no costs against the other defendant as the plaintiff abandoned her claims against it. The plaintiff was entirely unsuccessful on the motion. By their conduct in unilaterally and arbitrarily declining to follow the process mandated following consultation with and the agreement of counsel, the parties had defeated the intention of the court and produced an inefficient, time consuming and expensive result. </summary>
