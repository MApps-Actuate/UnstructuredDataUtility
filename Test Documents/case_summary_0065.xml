<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Appeal by the accused, Jimmie, from a sentence of two years plus a day following her guilty plea to robbery. The offence involved a violent purse-snatching from an 81-year-old victim. The police arrested Jimmie and found the victim's bank cards in her possession. The victim suffered minor physical injuries in the attack and continued to suffer from feelings of anxiety and insecurity when she left her home. Jimmie was a 46-year-old aboriginal woman and a chronic alcoholic. She was intoxicated at the time of the offence. She had a lengthy criminal record, which included 39 property-related offences, 10 offences involving violence, and seven breaches of court orders. At the time of the offence Jimmie was on probation. A term of the probation order required that she abstain from the consumption of alcohol. Since December 2006 she had been convicted of 10 breaches of probation and two breaches of undertaking, most of which related to breaches of a prohibition against consuming alcohol. 	HELD: Appeal dismissed. The sentencing judge did not err in focusing on the principles of denunciation and deterrence in crafting the sentence. She did not ignore the principle of rehabilitation in arriving at a fit sentence. Jimmie's behaviour at the time of the offence was so out of control as to constitute a threat to public safety. Her many breaches of court orders showed that she was unable to come to terms with her drinking. A prison sentence of some length was her best chance to develop strategies to combat her disease. </summary>
