<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Appeal by the mortgagor from a Master's decision dismissing its application that the petition for foreclosure be referred to the trial list and granting the mortgagee an order nisi of foreclosure. The mortgagor obtained a demand loan for a condominium development project. The mortgagor obtained a demand loan for the project. The loan was to cover only the purchase of the land and a portion of the construction costs. The mortgagor then decided to complete the project at one time rather than as a phased project. The mortgagor was unable to meet the bank's requirements to obtain construction financing for the entire project. When the mortgagor had not secured alternative construction financing and was in default under the terms of the existing mortgage, the bank demanded payment. When payment was not received, the bank commenced its petition. The mortgagor alleged that it had a collateral agreement with the mortgagee to finance 75 percent of the costs of construction of the entire project, in addition to the monies advanced to acquire the lands and that this agreement survived the changes made to the development of the project. The mortgagee argued that the alleged collateral agreement was not a defence to the foreclosure action. The Master found that the collateral agreement could support a counterclaim by the mortgagor but was not a defence to the foreclosure action. 	HELD: Appeal allowed. The matter was referred to the trial list. The assertion of the mortgagor that there was a collateral agreement by which the bank agreed to fund the construction costs of the development, could, if proven, amount to a defence to the bank's claim. There was no question that the mortgagor changed its approach to the development from proceeding in phases to building the entire project at once. If the mortgagor was successful in establishing that the change in the project development resulted from the bank's direction that fixed price contracts be entered into with the general contractor, and that the default occurred due to the bank's failure to honour its commitment to honour construction financing, the collateral agreement would be a defence to the foreclosure action. </summary>
