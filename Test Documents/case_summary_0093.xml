<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by the father for an order varying a 2002 child support order to reflect his actual income. The order was based on an imputed income of $75,000 per year since the father had not appeared at the hearing. The order required the father to pay child support of $973 for two children. As a result of a severe head injury, the father had been unable to work since 2008. The father's income tax returns reflected an income between $50,433 and $37,369. His 2008 income was $9,342. The father argued his support obligation should now be terminated as the children were now 20 and 21 and were working. There were significant support arrears owing. 	HELD: Application allowed. A change in circumstances was met by the changes in the father's income as well as his ability to earn an income due to his brain injury. The father never earned the income attributed to him in the order. Considering the means of the father, particularly since his brain injury, it was appropriate that the order be varied to reflect his actual earnings and that the arrears be reduced accordingly. As the children were both no longer in school and were working full-time, child support was terminated as of May 2009. The arrears were to be recalculated based on the father's actual income. </summary>
