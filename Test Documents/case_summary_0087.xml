<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Trial of the accused charged with assault causing bodily harm. The accused argued that he acted in self defence or that the complainant consented to the fight. At the time of the incident, the accused was six feet tall and weighed 170 pounds. The complainant, 15, weighed 115 pounds and was about five feet tall. The complainant and some friends were walking home. The complainant crossed the street on a red light. Various cars began honking. The complainant gestured with his finger and swore as he passed the accused's van and pushed on the van on its front. The accused parked his vehicle, exited and a fight broke out. 	HELD: The accused was convicted. Based on the testimony of the witnesses, the accused clearly intended to fight as he left his vehicle. The defence of self-defence was not made out. The accused was not assaulted. There was no evidence that the complainant moved toward the accused or that he struck him. The accused's description and demonstration of the complainant's stance with his fists raised clearly indicated a defensive position, not an assaultive one. The accused could not have mistaken the diminutive complainant's intentions as an assault upon him from which he had to defend himself by repelling force by force. There could not be a consensual fight as a minor could not consent to an adult's intentional application of force in a fight. Even if he could have consented to a fist fight with the accused, the consent was vitiated due to more than trifling injuries suffered by the complainant. </summary>
