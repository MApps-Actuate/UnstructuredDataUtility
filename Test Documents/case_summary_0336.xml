<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Crown application seeking to vacate an order releasing the respondent on a $70,000 surety and stringent conditions of house arrest. The respondent faced charges of choking, sexual assault, unlawful confinement, forced anal intercourse and assault with respect to five women. It was alleged that he had picked up the women, all sex trade workers, taken them to an isolated place and viciously attacked them. The offences allegedly occurred over six or seven months. The Crown sought an order detaining the respondent in custody pending his trial. The accused had no prior criminal record and there were no other outstanding charges. The issues were (a) whether the justice of the peace erred in releasing the accused on the tertiary ground, and (b) whether there was a material change of circumstances whereby the appeal was not only based on the record of the proceedings before the justice of the peace, and which warranted a review which in effect was a de novo hearing. 	HELD: Application allowed. The respondent was to be detained until his trial. The justice of the peace erred in failing to address the potential for a lengthy period of imprisonment, and in equating "risk of flight" as a relevant consideration on the tertiary ground. She erred in placing decisive weight on the quality of the respondent's bail arrangement. She further erred in not considering whether the tertiary ground established a separate and distinct basis for denying bail. Although she recognized that due to the egregious nature of the offences, the public might have concerns if the respondent was released, she did not have the concern in the absence of a record and in considering the plan in place. She did not analyze the factors on the tertiary ground together, and did not consider their combined effect on the issue of maintaining public confidence in the administration of justice. Therefore, she failed to view the four factors under the tertiary ground through the eyes of an informed, reasonable person who was cognizant of the philosophy of the legislative provisions, Charter values, and the actual circumstances of the case. There was no additional evidence, nor was there a material change in circumstances. </summary>
