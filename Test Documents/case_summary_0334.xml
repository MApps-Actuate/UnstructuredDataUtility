<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Motion by class counsel for a determination of pre and post-judgment interest rates governed by the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act -- The class members had been denied their equality rights when they were denied Canada Pension Plan survivor's pensions due to the fact that they were of the same sex as their deceased partners -- Following a decision from the Supreme Court of Canada, the plaintiffs were entitled to the survivor's pensions and were eligible for up to 12 months worth of arrears -- The plaintiffs submitted that the cause of action arose out of multiple provinces and, therefore, any determination of interest was to be governed by ss. 31(2) and 31.1(2) of the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act -- The defendant argued that the causes of action were combined and arose in a single province and, thus, the respective provincial regime would govern -- HELD: Motion allowed -- The suit was a national class action which arose in more than one province -- Therefore, the appropriate interest regime was the one set out in ss. 31(2) and 31.1(2) of the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act -- Moreover, the plaintiffs endured extreme hardship stemming from the discrimination they faced -- Thus, it was appropriate to fix post-judgment interest rates above provincial statutory rates and closer to the rates the pension fund actually earned during the relevant time period -- The pre-judgment interest rate was fixed at 5 per cent and the post-judgment interest rate was fixed at 8 per cent. </summary>
