<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application for approval of the terms of a partial settlement that was negotiated on consent of all parties -- The terms of the settlement involved the payment by the insurer of Gill and Purba, the amount of the limits of their available insurance which totalled $1 million plus what were described as partial indemnity fees payable to Marcoccia's solicitor in the amount of $250,000 plus GST in the amount of $15,000 and solicitor and client disbursements in the amount of $130,000 inclusive of GST -- The judge was required to approve a structured settlement placed by McKeller Structured Settlements Inc. with funding of $735,000 in eleven years and 4 months of payments with indexing at 2% per annum compounded, with the payments to start on December 15, 2006 in the amount of $6,018 per month -- Also at issue was the amount of Marcoccia's solicitor's fees -- The solicitor had retained the $250,000 partial indemnity fee, the GST of $15,000, the $130,000 inclusive of GST and over and above those sums, $150,000 representative of the solicitor's requested solicitor and client fees plus $9,000 of GST on that sum and a further $100,000 plus GST of $6,000 purportedly to be held in trust in an interest bearing account described as "a holdback to fund future fees" -- HELD: Partial settlement and management plan approved -- The solicitor and client fee of $150,000 and the GST sum of $9,000 over and above the partial indemnity fees were disallowed -- The amount was not in proportion to the partial settlement that had been obtained -- The other fees and disbursements were allowed, as was the holdback, which was not unreasonable given that litigation continued against the other defendant not involved in the partial settlement. </summary>
