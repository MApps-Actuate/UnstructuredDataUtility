<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by the Toronto Estates Office for directions regarding the filing of an Application Record by the Estate Trustees of the Estates of the deceased Robert McMichael and his wife Signe. Signe died in 2007 in Toronto. The Estate Trustees were issued a Certificate of Appointment of Estate Trustee with a Will by the Office for the wife. Robert pre-deceased Signe in 2003 in Orangeville. He appointed Signe as his executor. If she was unable to act the will appointed the Estate Trustees as executors. His will was not probated. The Estate Trustees filed the Application Record with the Office. Part of the relief claimed in the Application Record was the request for an order that Robert's will was valid and that the Estate Trustees were the executors of his Estate. The Office rejected it on the basis that some of the relief was being sought in the wrong jurisdiction. Robert's fixed place of abode when he died was in Belfountain, Ontario. The Office sought directions when the Estate Trustees disagreed with its decision. 	HELD: Application allowed. The Office correctly advised the Estate Trustees that a separate application for the issuance of a certificate of appointment as Robert's estate trustees had to be brought. Such an application had to be commenced in Dufferin County because that was the county Robert resided in when he died. The Estates Act and the applicable Rule required the application to be brought in the county where the deceased resided at the time of death because that was where the evidence required to adjudicate the request for the appointment of an estate trustee would be located. This requirement resulted in a more efficient and less costly appointment process. However, once the Estate Trustees commenced the application in Dufferin, they could apply to transfer that application to Toronto when they filed the wife's application in Toronto and could consolidate the two proceedings. </summary>
