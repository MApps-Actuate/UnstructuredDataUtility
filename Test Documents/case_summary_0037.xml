<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by the wife to set aside an order reinstating the husband's appeal after it had been dismissed as abandoned. The husband appealed from a July 2007 order, the form of which was not finalized and entered until October 2008. The husband was informed in August 2008 that the appeal would be dismissed as abandoned on February 26, 2009 if no steps were taken. He filed an application on February 25, 2009 to have the appeal removed from the inactive list. The application was not heard before the appeal was dismissed as abandoned. The judge who heard the husband's application accepted his explanation that he thought he could not take any further steps with the appeal until the order was entered. 	HELD: Application dismissed. The appeal stood as reinstated. The delay from the summer of 2007 until 2009 was inordinate but excusable in the unique circumstances. The wife failed to show any legal prejudice that resulted from the delay. The husband's appeal was not without merit. </summary>
