<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Motion by the father under the Ontario Family Law Act to terminate support to his daughter. Under an interim interim order, the father began paying child support in May 1995. When the father brought a divorce petition, he was ordered to pay child support as indexed under the Family Law Act. The daughter turned 18 in 1997 and completed high school in June 1998. She lived full-time with the mother and began attending college, but received special permission to complete a two-year program in three years. The father argued that this meant she was not enrolled in a full-time program of education as described in section 31 of the Act, and therefore she was no longer a child of the marriage. The mother asked that child support be continued according to the Child Support Guidelines. 	HELD: Husband's motion dismissed, and mother's motion allowed in part. The father was to pay support in the Guidelines amount until April 1, 2001. The divorce petition triggered an automatic stay concerning support under the Family Law Act. The father's motion had been properly considered under the Divorce Act. As the daughter was still pursuing her education at a reasonable level, she was unable to withdraw from parental charge or provide the necessities of life for herself. Even under the Family Law Act, she remained a child of the marriage. The father's support obligations were to terminate upon the daughter's graduation from college. </summary>
