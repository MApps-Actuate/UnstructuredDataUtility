<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by the defendants for a declaration that sections 5.1 and 9 of the Provincial Offences Act were unconstitutional. The applicants were charged with moving violations. The applicants argued that s. 5.1 cast an unfair burden on the accused to attend at the court office in person or by agent to file a notice of intention to dispute. The applicants also argued that s. 9 breached their rights by virtue of the fact that a person charged with an offence may be convicted without a trial notwithstanding attending in person or by agent to file an intention to dispute the trial. Finally, the applicants argued that s. 5.1 violated s. 15 of the Charter in that the legislation was not in force in all municipalities in Ontario and that there was discrimination against individuals based on where they lived. 	HELD: Application dismissed. There was no consequential burden on any person who was subject to s. 5.1. There was no requirement for a court appearance either in person or by agent. S. 9 did not violate any rights as it provided for an adjudication mechanism where there was no filed intention to dispute the allegations against a defendant and was to be read in the context of the rest of the Act. The inapplicability of either federal or provincial legislation in all geographic locations of either a province or Canada did not engage s. 15. The applicants failed to establish discrimination. </summary>
