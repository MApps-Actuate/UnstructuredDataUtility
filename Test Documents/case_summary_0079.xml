<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Appeal by the Purewals from an order for specific performance. The Purewals were the vendors under a contract for the sale of real property to 667975 B.C. Ltd. The property was to be developed and subdivided into five lots, and the Purewals were to retain one of these. As a condition of the contract, 667975 was required to provide a subdivision plan for the development by the closing date. The plan could not be obtained because the city required the property the Purewals intended to retain to be remediated. The judge found both parties liable for the remediation, and found the Purewals failed to act in good faith in not notifying 667975 that remediation was required. She found this a breach of the contract. She also found 667975 breached the contract by not providing the subdivision plan by the completion date. She found the Purewals were not entitled to repudiate the contract because of their breach, and ordered them to specifically perform the contract. 	HELD: Appeal allowed. The judge made an overriding and palpable error in finding 667975 was ready and willing to complete the contract once the remediation on the property was carried out. There was evidence showing the subdivision approval would not have been obtained even if the property had been remediated, because of a myriad of other matters that had to be resolved. Even if the Purewals breached the contract by not disclosing the required remediation in a timely manner, this was a minor matter that did not lead to the failure of 667075 to complete. The Purewals were under no contractual obligation to complete the remediation. </summary>
