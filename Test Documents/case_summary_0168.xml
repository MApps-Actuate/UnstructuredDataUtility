<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Appeal by the accused, Savage, from his conviction for driving with a blood alcohol level over .08 -- The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level over .08 in March, 2005 -- At trial in October 2005, the trial judge refused to admit breathalyzer certificate, finding that police lacked reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath sample demand -- She acquitted the accused of driving with a blood alcohol level over .08, but convicted him on the impaired driving charge -- On sentencing, the trial judge discovered that the accused had not been given an opportunity to call evidence, and the accused's lawyer asked to be removed from the record -- The trial judge declared a mistrial -- At the second trial, held ex parte in January, 2006 because the accused did not appear, the trial judge found the accused guilty of driving with a blood alcohol level over .08 -- The accused argued that he had been acquitted of that charge at the first trial and had been entitled to enter a plea of autrefois acquit -- He also claimed that the trial judge was functus officio and lacked jurisdiction in the second trial because the Crown had failed to lay a new information -- HELD: Appeal dismissed -- The declaration of mistrial in the first trial was within the trial judge's authority and discretion and applied to both charges -- The failure to give the accused an opportunity to call evidence went to the reasonableness of the verdict -- The trial judge was not functus officio in the second trial because a valid mistrial had been declared with respect to the charges and the first trial judge had declared the mistrial before sentencing -- The second trial was therefore not procedurally flawed. </summary>
