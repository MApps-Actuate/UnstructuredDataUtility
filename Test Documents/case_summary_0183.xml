<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Action by mortgagee for assessment of deficiency amount owing by defendant mortgagor -- Defendant defaulted on real property mortgage -- Mortgagee first advertised property by auction but then aborted public sale and proceeded with private sale without prior notice to mortgagor -- Principal amount of mortgage was $99,871 -- Plaintiff sued for deficiency of $27,981 and defendant was noted in default -- Plaintiff sought protective disbursements up to date of public auction -- Mortgage did not specifically authorize plaintiff to withdraw property from public auction and subsequently resell it by private contract without further notice to mortgagor or a subsequent encumbrancer or the further advertising of a notice of such sale by private contract -- HELD: Action allowed -- Judgment for plaintiff for $27,981 -- Since present action was mortgagee's action for deficiency, the immunity afforded to a mortgagee under s. 47(6) of Property Act was not an issue and appropriateness of sale procedure used did not have to be determined -- Amount obtained for property was reasonable and no reduction in plaintiff's claim thus warranted -- Plaintiff obtained no unfair advantage from sale. </summary>
