<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by the plaintiffs, Lang and her companies, for recognition and enforcement of a foreign judgment against Lapp and her company. The personal plaintiff and corporate plaintiffs resided in California. The personal defendant and corporate defendants resided in British Columbia. The parties were involved in a dispute regarding an oral contract under which the defendants managed the plaintiff, a recording artist. The Superior Court for the State of California dismissed the defendants' forum non conveniens motion and granted judgment in favour of the plaintiffs. They awarded damages of US$1.9 million for breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract. The defendants opposed recognition and enforcement of the judgment on the basis that it was obtained by fraud. They contended that the plaintiffs misrepresented their place of residence when the contract was made. They submitted that the plaintiffs misrepresented that the contract was made and substantially performed in California rather than British Columbia. They contended that the plaintiffs fraudulently represented that the defendants had deliberately breached their discovery obligations. They contended that the plaintiffs, in proving their damage claim, failed to disclose the manner in which the defendants had agreed to be paid. The plaintiffs denied fraud going to jurisdiction or the merits of the California decision. They submitted that the matters raised by the defendants were within their knowledge and could have been raised during the California proceedings. They submitted that the defendants attorned to the jurisdiction of the California court. They submitted that there was a real and substantial connection between the subject matter of the litigation and California, and thus the judgment should be recognized. 	HELD: Application allowed. The defendants failed to establish that the plaintiffs made false statements to the California court or deliberately withheld information thereby fraudulently inducing it to take jurisdiction. All of the facts related to the making and performance of the contract were within the knowledge of the defendants when they brought their forum non conveniens motion. In addition, the defendants failed to establish that the plaintiff made false representations that went to the merits of the California judgment and the assessment of damages. No new material facts were adduced that could not have been put before the California court through the exercise of reasonable diligence. The plaintiffs were thus entitled to an order for recognition and enforcement of their judgment. </summary>
