<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Sentencing of the accused convicted of two counts of arson. In each case he set fire to a mattress in a residence in order to terminate a relationship he was in at the time. The accused did not intend to cause harm to any persons. The accused, 24, was well-educated and had a good employment record. 	HELD: The accused was sentenced to two years less one day imprisonment. Without exemplary sanction, the accused was at high risk to re-offend. The court was concerned about the accused's desire to avoid dealing with normal human conflict in a manner acceptable to society. A punishment that emphasized personal deterrence and denunciation was absolutely required in this case. A conditional sentence would not deter the accused and adequately address the principle of denunciation. </summary>
