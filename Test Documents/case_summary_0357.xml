<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Motion by Savage for an order requiring Monastero to attend an independent medical examination. Monastero was claiming damages for personal injuries from a motor vehicle collision in 2000. She was then involved in a subsequent accident involving a deer. Affidavit evidence indicated that Monastero had attended numerous medical examinations with reports generated. A 2007 MRI of her cervical and thoracic spine indicated that there was a disc protrusion which compressed the spinal cord. Savage was seeking an independent medical examination of Monastero, and argued that the MRI might have been a triggering event for the disc protrusion. 	HELD: Motion dismissed. A Court could order a medical examination if the moving party established a need for further examination. A change in symptoms or complain or a change in circumstances was often associated with the test for need, and the overriding test was fairness and the ability to present the best evidence at trial. No opinion had been expressed as to the cause or timing of the disc protrusion. There was no evidence to suggest any change in Monastero's physical condition or circumstances. The defence medical examination in 2005 involved three days of testing. Monastero had been examined by over 20 medical experts and caregivers. In terms of fairness, permitting another defence medical examination at this stage would have necessitated a further examination to be arranged by Monastero's counsel, and put the trial date in jeopardy. </summary>
