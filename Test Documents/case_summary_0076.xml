<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by the strata corporation for special costs against Loveys. Loveys was a former unit owner who petitioned the court for relief concerning the schedule of unit entitlement for strata owners and the issue of some allegedly unauthorized balcony enclosures. She was subsequently denied leave to amend her petition to add other parties and to convert the petition to an action. The portion of her petition dealing with the enclosures was struck at the request of the strata corporation as vexatious and unnecessary, based on a resolution the strata council passed. Scale B costs of the motion to strike were ordered. Loveys' entire claim was subsequently struck when she sold her unit. The strata corporation sought special costs of the entire proceeding for conduct on Loveys' part it considered reprehensible and deserving of rebuke. 	HELD: Application allowed in part. It would be inappropriate to amend the previous costs order awarding only party and party costs to the corporation for the first motion to strike. Loveys' conduct in seeking to amend her petition deserved rebuke. She sought far-reaching forms of relief in her petition. She refused to listen to counsel for the corporation about her inadequate time estimate. She tried to bully the strata council into acceding to her demands. For this motion, the corporation was awarded special costs. For the balance of the proceedings, party and party costs were appropriate, despite the voluminous materials filed and the allegations of misconduct Loveys made against the corporation. </summary>
