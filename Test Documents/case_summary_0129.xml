<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>The plaintiffs, FCT Insurance, carrying on business as First Canadian Title, and First Canadian Title Ltd., sought a declaration that a provision in the New Brunswick Standards for the practice of Real Property Law was invalid. The Law Society opposed the claim and counter-claimed, alleging that the plaintiffs were illegally practicing law. Section 1 of the Land Titles Act set out the intent and purpose of the Act, being to provide a system for the registration of land in the province and related instruments, and to provide statutory authority for guaranteed land title. For a guarantee to apply, the land owner had to apply to change the title of his property from the Registry System to the new Land Titles System. The Form 2 affidavit of the applicant prescribed in the Land Titles Act regulation indicated that it may be sworn before a Commissioner of Oaths. It was not required that one be a lawyer to become a Commissioner of Oaths in New Brunswick. Approximately one year after the start of the Land Titles System, part III of the Law Society Standards for the practice of Real Estate Law came into effect. Under s. 52.1(h) of the Standards, the owner of a parcel of land being converted to the Land Titles System had to attend before a notary public to swear the accompanying Form 2 affidavit to the application. Under the standard the notary public had to explain the affidavit and the first registration of title (AFR) to that person and complete a form indicating that that had been done and explain to the deponent in person. Only lawyers were notary publics in New Brunswick. The issues that arose were whether s. 52.1(h) of the Standards adopted by the Law Society was illegal and unenforceable and, with respect to the counter-claim, whether the plaintiffs were illegally practicing law. 	HELD: Action allowed. The counter-claim was dismissed. The impugned provision of the Standards which restricted a lawyer to only accept the Form 2 Affidavit sworn before a notary public clearly conflicted with what was authorized and provided for in the Land Titles Act and the Regulations. It purported to prevent what the enabling and governing legislation permitted. The Law Society did not have the authority under its Act to restrict or change what was authorized and expressly allowed under the Land Titles Act and the Regulations. The impugned provision was ultra vires in that it was inconsistent with, and conflicted with the procedures provided for in the Land Titles Act and the Regulations. With respect to the counter-claim, the services offered and provided by the plaintiffs were not prohibited by the Law Society Act nor did they constitute the illegal practice of law. The services provided by the plaintiff were functions that included the practice of law. They were performed under the supervision of lawyers who were practicing members of the Law Society in good standing. </summary>
