<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by the Crown to set aside an order directing it to pay the accused's costs for its failure to make timely disclosure of videotape evidence. The videotapes were taken at the police station after the accused was arrested. He had been tasered at his home during an altercation with the RCMP, the subject of the charges against him. He allegedly had another altercation with the police at the station. Events at the police station were always taped. These tapes were not provided to either the defence or the Crown by the RCMP, despite numerous requests, until just prior to his trial. It then became clear the tapes disclosed were not the correct ones. The accused sought a stay of proceedings against him, but the judge instead ordered the Crown to pay costs associated with the late and insufficient disclosure. At trial, it came to light that an RCMP officer permitted the tapes to be destroyed. The judge then ordered a stay of several charges against the accused. The accused sought $5,500 in costs pursuant to the order. 	HELD: Application dismissed. The sanction against the Crown for the RCMP's failure to provide timely disclosure of the tapes was not rendered unreasonable because some of the charges against the accused were subsequently stayed. The accused was put to some additional expense because of the late disclosure. Costs were assessed at $3,000. Costs were not intended to be compensatory to the accused, but were penal in nature against the Crown. </summary>
