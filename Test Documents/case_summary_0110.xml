<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Appeal by RIL from his convictions for indecent assault, gross indecency, and non-consensual sexual intercourse with a female who was not his wife. The complainant in all three charges was TA, RIL's step-daughter. RIL and the complainant's mother married when TA was four years old and her brother was five years old. TA lived with her family and RIL until 1982, when she left the home at the age of 17 years. TA alleged RIL sexually abused her, hundreds of times, for as long as she could remember. She gave evidence about a few incidents only. The incidents began with touching and progressed to oral sex, masturbation, and intercourse. TA left home after she graduated from high school and went to live with a friend who kept a horse stable. TA's mother took steps to have her returned home but the authorities allowed her to remain with the friend. A police officer who interviewed TA at this time had notes to the effect that TA made allegations of sexual abuse by RIL, which she later withdrew. TA testified she withdrew the allegations to get the authorities to leave her alone and to prevent them from removing younger siblings from her mother's home. The charges were laid in response to a complaint TA made to police in 2000. The judge noted in her reasons for conviction that there was no independent evidence that confirmed TA's story. She did note TA's prior consistent statement to authorities from 1982. She also considered a statement from TA's brother that he overheard his mother and RIL have a screaming match and discussing RIL getting counseling at the time the family was trying to get TA home in 1982. 	HELD: Appeal dismissed. The evidence did not support a finding TA made a complaint of sexual assault against RIL in 1982. However, the judge did not place much emphasis on the 1982 allegations and recantation in her assessment of TA's credibility. The statements RIL allegedly made to TA's mother and the authorities in 1982 formed just a part of the evidence against RIL, and as such the judge was not required to assess whether or not they were made and whether or not they were incriminating before considering them. The judge's reasons did not disclose a failure on the judge's part to place the burden of proof on the Crown. </summary>
