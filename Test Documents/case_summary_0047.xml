<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by holder of licence for sale of liquor to quash decision of adjudicator finding it contravened Liquor Control and Licensing Act by permitting minor to consume liquor on premises controlled by it. The licensee held a liquor licence for the sale of liquor at an arena in Victoria, B.C. In November, 2007, two experienced police officer entered the arena in order to carry out a licensed premise check. At the time, a hockey game with approximately 1,500 individuals in attendance was underway. The police observed two groups of young men who appeared to be minors and observed that one of the youths was drinking beer out of the type of cup sold at the on-site kiosks. The officers observed no security personnel, approached the group and found that one of them was a minor in possession of a cup of beer. The youth was issued a ticket and his parents were notified. The officers later located the second group of youths and found that they had dumped the beer they had been drinking as they were standing near a puddle of beer. The licensee received a handwritten contravention notice which specified supply to minors, but did not reference any subsection of the Act. The Branch later provided clear notice that it was proceeding under s. 33(1)(a) of the Liquor Control and Licensing Act only. At the hearing, the youth testified that he paid a stranger to buy him a beer because he was underage. The adjudicator found that there was no evidence that the licensee sold alcohol to a minor, but allowed the hearing to continue on the charge that the licensee had permitted a minor to consume alcohol on the premises. Although the licensee had a security system in place including crowd management, the adjudicator found that the licensee did not observe as high a degree of diligence as it should have in the circumstances and permitted the minor to consume liquor on its premises. The licencee's primary complaint was that the Liquor Control and Licensing Branch failed to specify the subsection that it was charged under and submitted that without that specification, the general manager of the Branch had no jurisdiction to proceed. The licensee additionally alleged that the Branch engaged in procedurally unfair conduct in failing to specify the charge. The licensee also complained about the Branch's refusal to disclose a copy of the police file, contract information for the minors or a will say of the youth's evidence and that the date of contravention was not correctly specified in the notice of contravention. It was also alleged that the adjudicator ordered an unlawful penalty and made inconsistent findings in relation to the defence of due diligence. 	HELD: Application allowed in part and rehearing before new adjudicator ordered. The appropriate standard of review was reasonableness. The licensee was entitled to a high level of procedural fairness in relation to the notice requirements and the defence of due diligence. The refusal of the Branch to indicate that it was proceeding under s. 33(1)(c) of the Liquor Control and Licensing Act was procedurally unfair and the adjudicator erred in allowing the hearing to continue without some form of remediation such as an adjournment. The Act and Regulations required written notice of the alleged contravention, reasons for taking the action, details of the action and the proposed penalty. While there was no language stating that the Branch must state the allegedly contravened subsections, on both a plain and contextual reading of the statute and regulations, it was required to specify the subsections it intended to proceed with and the Branch failed to fulfil this obligation. A new adjudicator should be appointed to hear further evidence on the s. 33(1)(c) contravention. The claim relating to failure to disclose was dismissed on the basis that the petitioner was now aware of the case it had to meet, the subsection allegedly contravened and the kind of due diligence it was required to demonstrate. The imposition of a suspension of licence was within the authority of the adjudicator and the adjudicator's interpretation that the suspension would be served intermittently on major event days was not unreasonable. </summary>
