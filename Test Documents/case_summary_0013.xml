<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Appointment by client to review solicitor's account. The client had been involved in a motor vehicle accident in which she sustained a brain injury. She retained the services of a law firm to represent her in an action in relation to the motor vehicle accident and settled her case for $800,000. The law firm claimed a fee of $290,000. The client brought an action against the law firm for breach of contract and negligence and alleged that she was pressured to accept the settlement. The law firm countersued for damages for slander. The client retained another lawyer to proceed with the negligence and breach of contract action and when that lawyer had to withdraw, she retained the services of the solicitor to advise her on how she should proceed. By the time the second solicitor was retained, in February 2007, the trial had been set for May 2007 and the defendant law firm refused to adjourn the trial date. The solicitor took detailed notes of his meeting with the client which summarized the terms of his retainer agreement. The terms of the retainer were never put in writing and never sent to the client. The solicitor was very clear about the limits of the work he was undertaking and emailed the client clearly delineating what he was prepared to do, which was review the file and give her an opinion as to the likelihood of success. The solicitor was then retained to adjourn the trial. The solicitor's opinion was that it would be difficult for the client to win her case and very expensive for her to proceed with it. He recommended that she concentrate her efforts on trying to settle the matter. The solicitor never changed his position, but the client refused to accept it. As early as June 2007, the client complained about the solicitor's fees. In his response, the solicitor described the work he had done to review the file, give her an opinion and obtain the adjournment of the trial. In December 2007, the solicitor advised the client that she did not have a claim for damages for negligence and repeatedly communicated this opinion to the client verbally and in writing. After the solicitor requested that the client provide a further retainer, the client indicated that she could not afford the solicitor and sought to enter into another arrangement, which the solicitor declined. The solicitor negotiated a settlement to the law firm's counterclaim which included a payment of $130,000 to the client and a dismissal of the actions. Long after the settlement was reached and the settlement funds net of outstanding fees were forwarded to the client, the client informed the solicitor that she was not happy with the settlement. The client's main complaint was that the solicitor overcharged her for the work he did. In addition, the client was concerned about entries on the pre-bill summary and invoice in which no description for the time spent was provided. 	HELD: Account reduced by $7,745 inclusive of tax. Without an explanation for gaps on the invoice, the court could not assess whether the time entries were reasonable and those entries could not be allowed. Given that this was a difficult file, the skill of the solicitor and his character and standing in the legal profession, the amount involved, the time spent, that the client understood the fee arrangement, the importance of the matter to the client and the result obtained the fees were reasonable. The solicitor was entitled to interest on any fees that had not been paid. As the reduction did not constitute a one-sixth reduction and there were no special circumstances, the solicitors were entitled to their costs. </summary>
