<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by the Minister of Family and Community Services for permanent guardianship of the two children of the respondent parents, GG and DL -- The children were born in 1999 and 2001 -- The children were first apprehended in October 2003 when both parents were incarcerated -- The Minister also cited the family's living arrangements, the mother's drug use, and her use of physical discipline -- The ensuing years were characterized by continued re-apprehensions due to several relapses into drug use, periodic incarceration of each parent, transient addresses, inconsistent school attendance, and inadequate living and care arrangements for the children -- At present, the parents were no longer together and the father resided with his new partner and her children -- The children resided with foster parents for the previous two years -- The Minister sought a permanent guardianship order based on the father's history of drug addiction, the mother's continued drug use, and the violent tendencies of her current partner -- The father opposed the application -- He had tested drug free since autumn 2007 and had recently exercised weekly access visits with positive results -- The father sought the return of the children to his care -- The mother recognized that she was unable to parent the children -- She and the lawyer for the children supported the father's position -- HELD: Application dismissed -- The Minister's major concern regarding the parents related to drug use -- At the present time, the father was not using drugs and was able to parent the children during access visits -- The father's life had stabilized and he was employed -- His present residence was sufficient to accommodate the children -- Provided he remained drug free, he was able to meet the children's needs if they were returned to his care -- The children were thus returned to the father under a six-month supervisory order conditional upon abstinence from drugs. </summary>
