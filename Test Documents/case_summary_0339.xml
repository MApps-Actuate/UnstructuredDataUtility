<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Appeal by defendants Mackenzie and Barry Linn (the Linn defendants) from a decision of a Master dismissing their motion for an order bifurcating the trial of the action. Action arose out of a motor vehicle accident. A pickup truck operated by Mackenzie Linn collided with a passenger van owned and operated by the defendant Pauline Kovach. Pauline Kovach pled guilty to failing to yield the right of way to the Linn vehicle. Wayne Kovach was the father and litigation guardian of the minor plaintiffs, Andrew and Sarah Kovach, who were seated in the rear of the vehicle. Andrew Kovach sustained a brain injury and significant orthopaedic injuries as a result of the accident. The Linn defendants sought to have the issue of liability be tried first, before a jury. The Master's decision to dismiss the motion was based on the fact that jury notices had already been filed. Counsel agreed that a one to two-week jury trial could be scheduled within a short period of time, but that even a six to eight week trial for damages could not be incorporated into the court schedule for about one to one and a half years. Both the Linn and Kovach vehicles were insured under policies issued by Aviva Canada Inc. (Aviva) with third party policy limits; Aetna had offered to pay its policy limit of one million dollars as the insurer of Pauline Kovach. 	HELD: Appeal allowed. The liability issue, whether Mackenzie Linn exercised reasonable care in the operation of Linn vehicle, was not overly complex and was completely distinct from the damages issue. A finding on the liability issue in favour of the Linn defendants would render a damages trial unnecessary, particularly given Aetna's offer as Pauline Kovach's insurer. Bifurcation would result in considerable savings in litigation costs and court time and would minimize delays without causing any real prejudice to the plaintiffs. Holding that a bifurcation could never be ordered where a jury notice had been filed was an erroneous interpretation and application of the law. </summary>
