<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Motion for summary judgment in action by the plaintiff bank against the defendant, who had defaulted on his loan. The defendant had a line of credit with the plaintiff and had been in default of payments since June 2003. After sending several notices to the defendant, the plaintiff demanded the entire balance. In June, 2004, the defendant wrote to the plaintiff, acknowledging his liability. The action was commenced by the bank in 2007. The defendant argued that the cause of action was discovered with his acknowledgement letter, which happened in 2004 and was covered by the new Act. Thus, the defendant argued, the correct limitation period was two years and it had expired in 2006. The plaintiff argued that it discovered the default in 2003, when the defendant stopped making payments and the correct limitation period was the former one, which allowed six years. 	HELD: The motion for summary judgment was granted. The plaintiff was awarded $31,209 against the defendant. The new limitation period applied to acts or omissions occurring after January 1, 2004. The limitation period began running once the person making the claim discovered the cause of action. The plaintiff discovered the defendant's default when he stopped making payments on his line of credit in 2003. The defendant's formal acknowledgement of his liability in 2004 simply confirmed what the bank already knew. Each payment the defendant made confirmed his liability, thus his real confirmation was with his last payment, in April 2003. Since the cause of action was discovered by the plaintiff in 2003, the former limitation period applied and the plaintiff had six years to file a claim. Thus, the action had been commenced in time. </summary>
