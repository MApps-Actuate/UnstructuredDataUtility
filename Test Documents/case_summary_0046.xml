<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by four accused to quash direct indictment. In October 2004, six men were charged with a number of drug conspiracy counts. Their trial began in April 2006 and lasted until September 2008 at which time counsel was advised that the trial judge was too ill to continue hearing the case and a second trial judge was assigned. Upon the appointment of the second trial judge a dispute arose as to whether the trial should commence again as if no evidence had been taken or whether the trial should continue. The second judge found that the trial should commence again as if no evidence had been called. In November 2008, the Federal Court preferred a direct indictment of the six accused with four drug conspiracy counts. Proceedings were stayed against one accused because the court found a breach of his Charter rights by unreasonable delay. Four of the five remaining accused brought an application to quash the direct indictment on the basis of abuse of process and the statutory interpretation of s. 577 of the Criminal Code and a constitutional challenge of its validity. 	HELD: Application dismissed. Section 669.2(3) of the Criminal Code authorized the commencement of a new trial when a trial judge was unable to continue the trial because of illness. In this case, the direct indictment was preferred before the commencement of the new trial, which was a permissible exercise of the Attorney General's power to directly indict. The accused failed to show that there was overwhelming evidence that the proceedings were unfair to the point that they were contrary to the interests of justice. </summary>
