<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Application by the mother, Alexander, for custody of two children and an order prohibiting the removal of the children from Ontario. The father of the youngest child consented to the custody order. The other father was unable to be found. The mother came to Canada from Grenada as a visitor on a six-month visa. She remained illegally in Canada. She made an unsuccessful refugee claim and was ordered deported. She then applied for landing within Canada on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. This was also refused. She had recently submitted a further application with additional information. The mother was in detention with her children. The mother sought this non-removal order as a mechanism to assist her and her children in remaining in Canada. The Ministry of Citizenship and Immigration conceded jurisdiction but opposed the non-removal order. 	HELD: Application allowed in part. The purpose of the application was to have the court determine whether the relief requested was in the best interests of the children. This court was the only court considering the best interests of the children at this point. It was in the children's best interests to remain with their mother. Although the situation in Grenada had improved, it still posed a risk of harm to the children and their mother, who was their primary caregiver. The mother was granted custody of the children. The youngest child's father had access to the child. The court granted the non-removal order, and the children were not to be removed from Ontario for at least six months. </summary>
