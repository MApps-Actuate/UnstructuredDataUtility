<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>Trial of the accused charged with several offences under the Controlled Drugs and substances Act for selling and possessing hydriodic acid, a Class A precursor listed under the Precursor Control Regulations. The accused argued that the substance seized by police was not a Class A precursor as it was a mixture containing hydriotic acid. The chemicals seized from the accused contained hydriodic acid and hypophosphorous acid. The accused argued that hydriodic acid was a solution of only hydrogen iodide in water. The Class A precursors listed in Schedule VI of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act excluded mixtures of hydriodic acid. 	HELD: The accused was convicted. The substances seized from the accused constituted mixtures within both the ordinary and grammatical meaning of the word mixture, as well as the chemistry meaning of that word. The legislative provisions in question were open to two plausible but differing interpretations. Parliament's intention was to regulate and control the use of Class A Precursors in the manufacture of illicit substances. The interpretation of the legislative scheme that would best achieve this result was that Part 3 of Schedule VI of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act had no express application to a preparation or mixture containing hydriodic acid, but that Part 1 of Schedule VI was applicable because hydriodic acid was by its very definition a mixture. Thus the addition of another substance to hydriodic acid merely created another form of mixture of hydriodic acid. </summary>
