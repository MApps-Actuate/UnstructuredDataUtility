<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><case><summary>The applicant sought damages based on alleged misrepresentations made by the defendants with respect to water problems in the basement of a property she purchased -- The defendant denied making any misrepresentations, and claimed in the alternative that they were made as a representative of the estate and as such he was not personally liable -- HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $9,794 in damages plus $1,750 in costs -- The court was satisfied on the evidence that the cracks in the basement foundation were not readily apparent, nor were the problems with the chimney -- They were latent defects -- The plaintiff was led to believe the reason for water in the basement was on account of broken pipes while clearly that was not the case -- The foundation was badly damaged and the cracks were significant -- The plaintiffs relied on the defendant Robert Goyette's representations, and that is why they proceeded to renovate the basement -- It was reasonable to renovate the basement after having repaired the pipes -- The fact that Goyette ignored the questions put to him as to whether or not the basement was leaking was significant -- This amounted to nothing less than concealing the real reasons for the presence of the water in the basement -- Goyette had misrepresented the true condition of the house -- The plaintiff was awarded $296 for the cost of cleaning the septic system, $6,525 for the cost of repairs to the inside of the house, and $2,973 to repair the foundation. </summary>
