		//String text = "(Jim Cole/AP) WASHINGTON (AP)  CNN has changed its criteria for who qualifies for the next Republican presidential debate, giving former technology executive Carly Fiorina a better chance at appearing in the Sept. 16 prime-time affair. The news network announced the change on Tuesday following weeks of public pressure from Fiorina and her supporters. Fiorina is the only woman in the Republican field. She likely would not have been among the top 10 candidates on the debate stage on Sept. 16 as determined by national polling between July 16 and Sept. 10. The new terms would add any candidate who ranks in the top 10 in polling between Aug. 6 and Sept. 10  a period that better reflects Fiorinas rise in the polls. The final participants will be announced on Sept. 10. Watch Carly Fiorinas interview with Katie Couric below:";
		//String text = "GOP presidential candidates Donald Trump and Ben Carson. (AP) Businessman Donald Trump and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson lead a Loras College poll of likely Republican caucusgoers in Iowa. In the poll, released Tuesday, former Florida governor Jeb Bush is the only other candidate with double-digit support. For the 502 likely Republican caucusgoers polled statewide, 24.5% chose Trump as their top candidate, 18.1% chose Carson, and 10.4% named Bush as their top choice. The Loras poll follows a Monmouth University poll released Monday that showed Trump and Carson tied with 23% support in Iowa, and Carson was a close second to Trump in a Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics Iowa poll released over the weekend. “Iowa has historically been receptive to those outside the typical mold of ‘politician,’ and we may be seeing a repeat of that this year,” Christopher Budzisz, associate professor of politics and director of the Loras College Poll, said in a statement. “But, time is not always kind to the summer frontrunners.” Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker came in fourth and fifth place, garnering 6.6% and 6.2% respectively. The poll was conducted Aug. 24-27 and had an error margin of 4.37%.

		String text = "Jeb Bush bowed out of the race for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination on Saturday night, putting to an end one of Americas most prominent political dynasties and, frankly, one of the saddest campaigns in recent memory. Below, a look back at seven of the most awkward moments from Jebs bid for the White House. Jeb! Perhaps we shouldve seen it coming. In what appeared to be an ill-fated attempt to distance himself from the baggage that comes with the family name, the former Florida governors official campaign logo effectively replaced Bush with an exclamation point. It was quickly, and widely, mocked. pic.twitter.com/PTcgx420KC  Jeb Bush (@JebBush) June 14, 2015 Jeb Bushs campaign logo looks like the noise a Batman punch would make. pic.twitter.com/GnRB2jzCOX  Talmadge Blevins (@talign) June 14, 2015 I went ahead and translated Jebs logo into Spanish for him. Seems like a huge oversight. pic.twitter.com/3ljntvrJ9z  Michael Deppisch (@deppisch) June 14, 2015 The Trump low-five Debates werent really Jebs thing. During the GOP debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif., in September, Bush was asked what his Secret Service code name would be as president. Eveready, Bush replied. Its very high energy, Donald. It was a good line that elicited some laughs, even from Donald Trump. Had Bush left it there, things wouldve been fine. Instead, when Trump extended his hand in what appeared to be the low-five position, Bush went in for an all-too-aggressive slap. Jeb Kush At the same debate, Bush admitted to having smoked pot. Forty years ago, I smoked marijuana, and I admit it, he said. Im sure that other people might have done it and may not want to say it in front of 25 million people. My moms not happy that I just did. The awkward admission drew more laughter from the audience, led to an apology tweet and sparked the Jeb Kush meme online. JEB KUSH pic.twitter.com/r02zfu8qsx  BuzzFeed (@BuzzFeed) September 17, 2015 Sorry Mom  Jeb Bush (@JebBush) September 17, 2015 Supergirl During a question-and-answer session at a campaign event in October, Bush was asked who his favorite superhero is. I dont know, Bush replied. Im kind of old-school. I like the old-school guys, like Batman. A little dark these days. Again, things wouldve been fine, but for some reason Bush kept talking. I saw that theres a new Supergirl on TV, he said. \"I saw that while I was working out this morning, there was an ad. She looked kinda ... she looked pretty hot. I dont know which channel its on, but Im looking forward to that. When asked for a response, Melissa Benoist, the actress and recipient of Bushs unsolicited compliment, couldnt contain her laughter. I heard about it, but I dont know what I think about it, Benoist said on \"CBS This Morning. Im glad hes excited to watch the show. Baby Hitler A month later, Bush established himself as the leading pro-time-travel-in-order-to-kill-an-evil-dictator candidate in the 2016 presidential race, saying he would gladly travel back in time in order to kill baby Adolf Hitler, given the opportunity. Hell yeah I would! Bush told the Huffington Post. You gotta step up, man. The chest bump Last week, former President George W. Bush hit the campaign trail in a last-second bid to boost his little brothers chances in South Carolina, appearing in a campaign ad that touted Jebs record as Florida governor  and his chest-bumping ability. Read More Please clap No moment summed up Jeb Bushs 2016 presidential campaign better than this one. At a town hall event in New Hampshire earlier this month, the former Florida governor and Republican presidential hopeful asked attendees to please clap after his call for the next commander in chief to be a lot quieter was met with silence. I wont trash-talk, Bush said at the event in Hanover, N.H., a day after finishing a distant sixth in the Iowa caucuses. I will not be a divider in chief or an agitator in chief. I wont be out there blowharding, talking a big game without backing it up. I think the next president needs to be a lot quieter, but send a signal that were prepared to act in the national security interests of this country  to get back in the business of creating a more peaceful world. After failing to elicit applause, an exasperated Bush pleaded with the crowd. Please clap, he said.";
